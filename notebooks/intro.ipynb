Flexible, scalable, and secure, the ESW6300 provides resilient wireless mesh solutions built directly into your own hardware or IT solutions.\\\\n\\\\n### Product overview\\\\n\\\\n###### Cisco 6300 Series Embedded Services Access Points (ESW6300) integrate wireless mesh networking into heavy-industry and smart-city assets. Purpose-built with 802.11ac Wave 2, Cisco DNA Assurance, and Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), the ESW6300 provides a dependable and secure connectivity solution in almost any work environment. Dual Power over Ethernet (PoE) and PoE+ ports provide power and downlink connectivity to smart connected devices and sensors, and a single USB-out port allows for custom integrations. \\\\n\\\\n The ESW6300 offers a scalable and secure mesh architecture for high-performance Wi-Fi services, and can also serve as an advanced static or mobile Workgroup Bridge (WGB). Its embeddable form factor adds connectivity almost anywhere it can fit—without compromising aesthetics or requiring cumbersome mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n### Features and benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1. ESW6300 access points features and benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|802.11ac Wave 2 radio|Provides up to 867-Mbps data rates with 2 x 2 Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) and up to two spatial streams.|\\\\n|Multiuser MIMO (MU- MIMO)|Allows transmission of data to multiple 802.11ac Wave 2-capable clients simultaneously to improve the client experience. Prior to the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard, access points could transmit data to only one client at a time, typically referred to as single-user MIMO.|\\\\n|Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) port|Supports optical, fiber-based network connectivity for remote locations.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Dual PoE-out|Send power to—and backhaul data directly from—local IoT assets, such as IP cameras, sensors, or tracking systems.|\\\\n|Flexible deployment modes|Allows for deployment in a variety of ways, including as traditional access points and in mesh networks. The access points can also be deployed with the Cisco Mobility Express Solution. This deployment is ideal for small to medium-sized networks that require 50 or fewer access points without a physical controller. All deployment modes are easy to set up and configure.|\\\\n|No enclosure|Enables deployment of the access point where it is needed. The 6300 Embedded Services Series easily integrates into larger hardware, like light poles, without disturbing the aesthetics of the area.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Flexible, embedded mesh networking\\\\n\\\\n###### Cities and industrial environments were not designed for digital transformation. Flexibility is key to new connectivity deployments. Now you can remove constraints with the Cisco ESW6300. The embeddable form factor and wireless mesh capabilities allow for a myriad of successful deployment scenarios, without the requirement of cumbersome cabling. Create an expansive—and nearly invisible—network almost anywhere. You can configure the ESW6300 with: \\\\n\\\\n   - Cisco FlexConnect, a wireless solution for remote deployments. FlexConnect mode enables\\\\n###### configuration and control of access points in a separate area through a WAN link, without having to deploy an additional controller.\\\\n\\\\n   - Bridge mode. The access point is configured to build a wireless mesh network where wired network\\\\n###### cabling is not available.\\\\n\\\\n   - Flex+Bridge mode, which allows for both FlexConnect and Bridge mode to operate on the same\\\\n###### access point.\\\\n\\\\n### Product specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Table 2.

Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network\\\\ndevice. The various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on the device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco Catalyst access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco\\\\nprovides turnkey solutions with Plug and Play (PnP) capabilities that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n - **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series support a wide range of**\\\\n\\\\nautomation features and provide robust open APIs over NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG data models for external\\\\ntools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n - **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a switch to a destination. The data**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmonitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800 Series, these trustworthy systems enable hardware and software authenticity assurance for supply\\\\nchain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities\\\\ninclude:\\\\n\\\\n- **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other software are**\\\\n\\\\nauthentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable hardware, mitigating**\\\\n\\\\nthreats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be loaded, regardless of a user\\'s privilege level. It\\\\nprovides layered protection against the persistence of illicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n- **Cisco Trust Anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution provides hardware authenticity**\\\\n\\\\nassurance to uniquely identify the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the product\\\\nis genuine.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate,**\\\\n\\\\nand contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies,\\\\nunauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated classification engine for rogues and aWIPS is built on Cisco DNA\\\\nCenter. A fully integrated stack for the WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2,\\\\nand Cisco Catalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity, ease of\\\\nuse, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\nResiliency and high availability\\\\n\\\\n - **Stateful Switchover (SSO): Stateful Switchover with an active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services,**\\\\n\\\\nand clients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n - **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) and hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and avoiding the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a\\\\npackage that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you\\\\nto address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform\\\\ninternally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into\\\\nthe subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series comes**\\\\n\\\\nwith intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades can now be done in stages,\\\\nand access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n - Standby Monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in HA mode enables monitoring the health of the system on\\\\n\\\\nstandby controller in an HA pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going\\\\nthrough the active controller. For more details refer technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All access point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process. With just a click, your network\\\\nautomatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives the new software that is pushed via\\\\nthe active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes over your network, while your previously\\\\nactive 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software upgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling\\\\naccess point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered fashion without impacting any wireless session. This\\\\nprocedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from the controller and without the need for an external\\\\norchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS Software FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of**\\\\n\\\\nthe network infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication visibility and control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nencrypted applications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype,\\\\nOffice 365, Microsoft Lync, Cisco WebEx, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure.\\\\nNBAR2 provides the network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application\\\\nusage while helping ensure a quality user experience and securing the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to\\\\nreport application performance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime,\\\\nCisco Stealthwatch, or any compliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service (QoS)\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior QoS: QoS technologies are a set of tools and techniques for managing network resources and are considered**\\\\n\\\\nthe key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9800 Series consists of classification and marking, policing and markdown, and scheduling, shaping, and queuing\\\\nfunctions. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent platform-independent and flexible configuration\\\\nbehavior. The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series also supports 2-level hierarchical or nested policies.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-L has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using the WebUI or Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that enables provisioning of the device, simplifying**\\\\n\\\\ndevice deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience.

This software release includes all the\\\\nfeatures listed earlier in the Product Benefits section.\\\\n\\\\nTable 9 lists the minimum software requirements for the controller models.\\\\n\\\\n## Licensing\\\\n\\\\nNo licenses are required to boot up a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller. However, in order to connect any\\\\naccess points to the controller, Cisco DNA software subscriptions are required. To be able to connect to a Cisco Catalyst 9800\\\\nSeries controller, each access point requires a Cisco DNA subscription license.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nDetermining license requirements for access points connecting to Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers\\\\n\\\\nAccess points connecting to the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series have new and simplified software subscription packages.\\\\n\\\\nThey can support both tiers of Cisco DNA software: Cisco DNA Essentials and Cisco DNA Advantage.\\\\n\\\\nCisco DNA software subscriptions provide Cisco innovations on the access point. They also include perpetual Network Essentials\\\\nand Network Advantage licensing options, which cover wireless fundamentals such as 802.1X authentication, QoS, and PnP;\\\\ntelemetry and visibility; and single sign-on, as well as security controls.\\\\n\\\\nCisco DNA subscription software has to be purchased for a 3-, 5-, or 7-year subscription term. Upon expiration of the\\\\nsubscription, the Cisco DNA features will expire, whereas the Network Essentials and Network Advantage features will remain.\\\\n\\\\nFor the full feature list of Cisco DNA Software, including the perpetual Network Essentials and Network advantage, please see the\\\\nfeature matrix: https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/products/software/dna-subscription-wireless/en-sw-sub-matrix-wireless.html?oid=\\\\nporew018984.\\\\n\\\\nTwo modes of licensing are available:\\\\n\\\\n - Cisco Smart Licensing is a flexible licensing model that provides you with an easier, faster, and more convenient way to\\\\n\\\\npurchase and manage software across the Cisco portfolio and across your organization. And it’s secure- you control what\\\\nusers can access. With Smart Licensing you get:\\\\n\\\\n◦ Easy Activation: Smart licensing establishes a pool of software licenses that can be used across the entire\\\\n\\\\norganization-no more PAKs (Product Activation Keys).\\\\n\\\\n◦ Unified Management: My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) provides a complete view into all of your Cisco Products and\\\\n\\\\nservices in an easy-to-use portal, so you always know what you have and what you are using.\\\\n\\\\n◦ License Flexibility: Your software is not node-locked to your hardware, so you can easily use and transfer\\\\n\\\\nlicenses as needed.\\\\n\\\\n[To use Smart Licensing, you must first set up a Smart Account on Cisco Software Central (software.cisco.com).](https://software.cisco.com/software/csws/ws/platform/home?locale=en_US)\\\\n\\\\n[For more detailed overview on Cisco Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide.](https://cisco.com/go/licensingguide)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Specific License Reservation (SLR) is a feature used in highly secure networks. It provides a method for customers to\\\\n\\\\ndeploy a software license on a device (product instance) without communicating usage information to Cisco. There is no\\\\ncommunication with Cisco or a satellite. The licenses are reserved for every controller. It is node-based licensing.\\\\n\\\\nFour levels of license are supported on the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers. The controllers can be\\\\nconfigured to function at any one of the four levels.\\\\n\\\\n - Cisco DNA Essentials: At this level the Cisco DNA Essentials feature set will be supported.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco DNA Advantage: At this level the Cisco DNA Advantage feature set will be supported.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNE: At this level the Network Essentials feature set will be supported. This is available with Cisco DNA Essentials.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nterm expiration. And for customers who purchase Cisco DNA Advantage, Network Advantage will be supported and will continue\\\\nto function even after term expiration.\\\\n\\\\nInitial bootup of the controller will be at the Cisco DNA Advantage level.\\\\n\\\\nFor questions, contact the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers Licensing mailer group at\\\\n[ask-catalyst9800licensing](mailto:ask-catalyst9800licensing@cisco.com)\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9800-L Wireless Controller has enhanced capability to increase performance through a Performance license.\\\\nThis Performance license allows customers to connect with 500 access points and 10,000 clients and gives a higher throughput.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n - Features - 9800-L - 9800-L with Performance License\\\\n\\\\n - APs supported - 250 - 500\\\\n\\\\n - Clients supported - 5000 - 10,000\\\\n\\\\n - Throughput with IMIX - 5 Gbps - 5 Gbps\\\\n\\\\n - Throughput without IMIX - 5 Gbps - 10 Gbps [*]\\\\n\\\\n*** With 1374-byte packet size**\\\\n\\\\n - Customer will have an option to select this Performance license while buying the 9800-L wireless controller or can order as\\\\n\\\\nspare.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - The Performance license is a perpetual license that is separate from the Cisco DNA license.

Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network\\\\ndevice. The various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on the device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco Catalyst access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco\\\\nprovides turnkey solutions with Plug and Play (PnP) capabilities that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n - **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series support a wide range of**\\\\n\\\\nautomation features and provide robust open APIs over NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG data models for external\\\\ntools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n - **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a switch to a destination. The data**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmonitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800 Series, these trustworthy systems enable hardware and software authenticity assurance for supply\\\\nchain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities\\\\ninclude:\\\\n\\\\n- **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other software are**\\\\n\\\\nauthentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable hardware, mitigating**\\\\n\\\\nthreats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be loaded, regardless of a user\\'s privilege level. It\\\\nprovides layered protection against the persistence of illicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n- **Cisco Trust Anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution provides hardware authenticity**\\\\n\\\\nassurance to uniquely identify the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the product\\\\nis genuine.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate,**\\\\n\\\\nand contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies,\\\\nunauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated classification engine for rogues and aWIPS is built on Cisco DNA\\\\nCenter. A fully integrated stack for the WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2,\\\\nand Cisco Catalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity, ease of\\\\nuse, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\nResiliency and high availability\\\\n\\\\n - **Stateful Switchover (SSO): Stateful Switchover with an active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services,**\\\\n\\\\nand clients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n - **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) and hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and avoiding the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a\\\\npackage that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you\\\\nto address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform\\\\ninternally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into\\\\nthe subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series comes**\\\\n\\\\nwith intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades can now be done in stages,\\\\nand access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n - Standby Monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in HA mode enables monitoring the health of the system on\\\\n\\\\nstandby controller in an HA pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going\\\\nthrough the active controller. For more details refer technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All access point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process. With just a click, your network\\\\nautomatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives the new software that is pushed via\\\\nthe active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes over your network, while your previously\\\\nactive 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software upgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling\\\\naccess point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered fashion without impacting any wireless session. This\\\\nprocedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from the controller and without the need for an external\\\\norchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS Software FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of**\\\\n\\\\nthe network infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication visibility and control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nencrypted applications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype,\\\\nOffice 365, Microsoft Lync, Cisco WebEx, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure.\\\\nNBAR2 provides the network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application\\\\nusage while helping ensure a quality user experience and securing the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to\\\\nreport application performance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime,\\\\nCisco Stealthwatch, or any compliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service (QoS)\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior QoS: QoS technologies are a set of tools and techniques for managing network resources and are considered**\\\\n\\\\nthe key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9800 Series consists of classification and marking, policing and markdown, and scheduling, shaping, and queuing\\\\nfunctions. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent platform-independent and flexible configuration\\\\nbehavior. The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series also supports 2-level hierarchical or nested policies.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-L has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using the WebUI or Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that enables provisioning of the device, simplifying**\\\\n\\\\ndevice deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image. There is\\\\nno need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-1 configuration and from\\\\nthen on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\\\\n\\\\n## Specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 8.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Table 8.

They are rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and secure, and are\\\\ndesigned specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications include small business, financial, healthcare, and retail.\\\\nFully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs deliver enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications\\\\nto stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. The Cisco 819 4G LTE 2.0 M2M is the industry leader to bring enterprise grade wireline like\\\\nfunctionality such as Quality of Service (QoS) for cellular, Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF), advanced VPN, and Unified Communications solutions over\\\\nLTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Non-Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router with dual 802.11a/g/n radio WiFi\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs serve as the single, horizontal platform that enhances the Cisco implementation of\\\\n“any device, anywhere” across multiple industries, including small business, small remote branch, banking, retail, healthcare, and government. It also provides the\\\\nability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings\\\\nbased on Cisco architecture.\\\\n\\\\nCisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide geographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports\\\\nenterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco 819GW platforms concurrently support both 4G LTE for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual\\\\nradio WLAN on the same platform. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology, to\\\\ncreate a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated AP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a\\\\nwireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity along with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability\\\\nand coverage for legacy devices and dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Cisco 819 ISR with integrated 4G LTE and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access Point is available at\\\\n[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 3 LTE standards. They provide persistent, reliable\\\\nLTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The following models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-GA-EK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 3), 2100 MHz (band 1),**\\\\n\\\\nor 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz (band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2), and 2100 MHz\\\\n(band 1).\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-MNA-AK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), 850 MHz (band 5), 700 MHz**\\\\n\\\\n(band 13), 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; or 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), with EVDO Rev A/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires no additional hardware or client\\\\n\\\\nsoftware. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for example, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular\\\\nsecurity and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area Application Engines (WAEs) that work\\\\n\\\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic\\\\nand acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmanagers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to\\\\n\\\\nsupplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100\\\\nMbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data\\\\nservices can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on\\\\nthese performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN: This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Name) APN so that Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate**\\\\n\\\\ntraffic. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the bearer is part of show**\\\\n\\\\nCLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this service. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP**\\\\n\\\\nspec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at the service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP)\\\\ndependent, and requires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can be integrated with Cisco Unified**\\\\n\\\\nCommunications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster\\\\nand has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours,\\\\nwithout worrying about availability of broadband services and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be\\\\ncustomized to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and\\\\nresiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable businesses to stay productive during service\\\\nprovider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different wireless networks is\\\\ntransparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the\\\\nuser’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile\\\\nnetwork or subnet to stay connected. The dual radio WLAN on the 819 can serve as both a client and an access-point.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs for low-cost broadband\\\\naccess, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements.

More information on the\\\\n\\\\n[Cisco 3500 AP is available at: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\n|Note: Due to new FCC WiFi June 2016 regulation (FCC rules for part 15.409), the WLAN radio used in the ISR\\'s (specifically C819 –A WiFi Domain with AP802 dual 802.11 radio) Cisco will be issuing a new grant for the 5GHz dual 802.11n radio. The specific reason for the change is due to the inability of the radio to detect the various radar pulses (DFS function) over the entire bandwidth of the channels in the 5250-5350 and the 5500-5700 A radio channel bands (which will be disabled). As a consequence the radio will now operate from 5150-5250 and 5745-5850 A radio bands. This will provide a total of nine channels in the 5GHz range.|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Multiple WAN and LAN Connections||\\\\n|Four-port 10/100-Mbps managed switch|● Allows for multiple Ethernet device connectivity in a small office or other remote location with the ability to designate a port as the network edge. ● VLANs allow for secure segmentation of network resources. ● Multiple LAN and WAN devices can be connected to standard 10/100 Ethernet or serial interfaces.|\\\\n|WAN diversity|● Multiple WAN links are supported: Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and 4G LTE provide for business continuity and WAN diversity.

They are rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and secure, and are\\\\ndesigned specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications include small business, financial, healthcare, and retail.\\\\nFully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs deliver enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications\\\\nto stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. The Cisco 819 4G LTE 2.0 M2M is the industry leader to bring enterprise grade wireline like\\\\nfunctionality such as Quality of Service (QoS) for cellular, Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF), advanced VPN, and Unified Communications solutions over\\\\nLTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Non-Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router with dual 802.11a/g/n radio WiFi\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs serve as the single, horizontal platform that enhances the Cisco implementation of\\\\n“any device, anywhere” across multiple industries, including small business, small remote branch, banking, retail, healthcare, and government. It also provides the\\\\nability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings\\\\nbased on Cisco architecture.\\\\n\\\\nCisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide geographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports\\\\nenterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco 819GW platforms concurrently support both 4G LTE for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual\\\\nradio WLAN on the same platform. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology, to\\\\ncreate a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated AP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a\\\\nwireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity along with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability\\\\nand coverage for legacy devices and dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Cisco 819 ISR with integrated 4G LTE and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access Point is available at\\\\n[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 3 LTE standards. They provide persistent, reliable\\\\nLTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The following models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-GA-EK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 3), 2100 MHz (band 1),**\\\\n\\\\nor 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz (band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2), and 2100 MHz\\\\n(band 1).\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-MNA-AK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), 850 MHz (band 5), 700 MHz**\\\\n\\\\n(band 13), 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; or 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), with EVDO Rev A/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires no additional hardware or client\\\\n\\\\nsoftware. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for example, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular\\\\nsecurity and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area Application Engines (WAEs) that work\\\\n\\\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic\\\\nand acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmanagers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to\\\\n\\\\nsupplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100\\\\nMbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data\\\\nservices can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on\\\\nthese performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN: This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Name) APN so that Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate**\\\\n\\\\ntraffic. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the bearer is part of show**\\\\n\\\\nCLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this service. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP**\\\\n\\\\nspec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at the service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP)\\\\ndependent, and requires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can be integrated with Cisco Unified**\\\\n\\\\nCommunications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster\\\\nand has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours,\\\\nwithout worrying about availability of broadband services and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be\\\\ncustomized to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and\\\\nresiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable businesses to stay productive during service\\\\nprovider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different wireless networks is\\\\ntransparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the\\\\nuser’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile\\\\nnetwork or subnet to stay connected. The dual radio WLAN on the 819 can serve as both a client and an access-point.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs for low-cost broadband\\\\naccess, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements.

More information on the\\\\n\\\\n[Cisco 3500 AP is available at: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\n|Note: Due to new FCC WiFi June 2016 regulation (FCC rules for part 15.409), the WLAN radio used in the ISR\\'s (specifically C819 –A WiFi Domain with AP802 dual 802.11 radio) Cisco will be issuing a new grant for the 5GHz dual 802.11n radio. The specific reason for the change is due to the inability of the radio to detect the various radar pulses (DFS function) over the entire bandwidth of the channels in the 5250-5350 and the 5500-5700 A radio channel bands (which will be disabled). As a consequence the radio will now operate from 5150-5250 and 5745-5850 A radio bands. This will provide a total of nine channels in the 5GHz range.|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Multiple WAN and LAN Connections||\\\\n|Four-port 10/100-Mbps managed switch|● Allows for multiple Ethernet device connectivity in a small office or other remote location with the ability to designate a port as the network edge. ● VLANs allow for secure segmentation of network resources. ● Multiple LAN and WAN devices can be connected to standard 10/100 Ethernet or serial interfaces.|\\\\n|WAN diversity|● Multiple WAN links are supported: Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and 4G LTE provide for business continuity and WAN diversity.

Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards-based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network device.\\\\nThe various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on a device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco provides\\\\nturnkey solutions such as Plug and Play (PnP) that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800-80 Wireless Controller support a wide**\\\\n\\\\nrange of automation features and provide robust open APIs over Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) using YANG\\\\ndata models for external tools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n- **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a wireless controller to a destination.**\\\\n\\\\nThe data to be streamed is driven through subscription to a data set in a YANG model. The subscribed data set is\\\\nstreamed out to the destination at configured intervals. Additionally, Cisco IOS XE enables the push model, which provides\\\\nnear-real-time monitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\n**Always on**\\\\n\\\\n - **High availability: Stateful switchover with 1:1 active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services, and**\\\\n\\\\nclients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) with hot patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a bug fix**\\\\n\\\\nwithout bringing down the entire network and eliminates the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a\\\\npackage that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you\\\\nto address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform\\\\ninternally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into\\\\nthe subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n- **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-80 Wireless**\\\\n\\\\nController comes equipped with intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades\\\\ncan now be done in stages, and access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Standby monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in high-availability mode enables monitoring the health of\\\\n\\\\nthe system on a standby controller in a high-availability pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF)\\\\nand CLIs without going through the active controller. For more details refer to the technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All access point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process.\\\\n\\\\nWith just a click, your network automatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives the\\\\nnew software that is pushed via the active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes over\\\\nyour network, while your previously active 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software\\\\nupgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling access point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered\\\\nfashion without impacting any wireless session. This procedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from\\\\nthe controller and without the need for an external orchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\n**Security**\\\\n\\\\n - **Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA): ETA is a unique capability for identifying malware in encrypted traffic coming from the**\\\\n\\\\naccess layer. Since more and more traffic is being encrypted, the visibility this feature provides related to threat detection is\\\\ncritical for keeping your network secure at different layers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800-80, these trustworthy systems help assure hardware and software authenticity for supply chain trust\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ny g g y\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable hardware,**\\\\n\\\\nmitigating threats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be loaded, regardless of a\\\\nuser\\'s privilege level. It provides layered protection against the persistence of illicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Cisco trust anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution hardware uniquely**\\\\n\\\\nidentifies the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the product is\\\\ngenuine.\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect,**\\\\n\\\\nlocate, mitigate, and contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless\\\\nnetwork anomalies, unauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated classification engine for rogues and\\\\naWIPS is built on Cisco DNA Center. A fully integrated stack for the WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, a\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2, and Cisco Catalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides\\\\nimproved detection and security, simplicity, and ease of use, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\n**Flexible NetFlow**\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of the**\\\\n\\\\nnetwork infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\n**Application visibility and control**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Next-Generation Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR2): NBAR2 enables advanced application**\\\\n\\\\nclassification techniques, with up to 1400 predefined and well-known application signatures and up to 150 encrypted\\\\napplications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800-80. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype, Office 365,\\\\nMicrosoft Lync, Cisco Webex, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure. NBAR2 provides\\\\nthe network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application usage while helping\\\\nensure a quality user experience and securing the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to report application\\\\nperformance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime, Stealthwatch, or any\\\\ncompliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\n**Quality of service**\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior Quality of Service (QoS): QoS technologies are tools and techniques for managing network resources and are**\\\\n\\\\nconsidered the key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800-80 consists of classification of traffic based on packet data as well as application recognition and traffic\\\\ncontrol actions such as dropping, marking and policing. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent\\\\nplatform-independent and flexible configuration behavior. The 9800-80 also supports policies at two levels of target: BSSID\\\\nas well as client. Policy assignment can be granular down to the client level.\\\\n\\\\n**Smart operation**\\\\n\\\\n - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-80 has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using WebUI or the Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that provides the ability to provision the device,**\\\\n\\\\nsimplifying device deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image.\\\\nThere is no need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-0 and day-1\\\\nconfiguration and from then on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\\\\n\\\\n## Specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 8.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\nItem Specification\\\\n\\\\n**Wireless** [IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11d, WMM/802.11e, 802.11h, 802.11n,](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns767/)\\\\n802.11k, 802.11r, 802.11u, 802.11w, 802.11ac Wave 1 and Wave 2, 802.11ax\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Wired, switching, and**\\\\n**routing**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIEEE 802.3 10BASE-T, IEEE 802.3u 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T, 1000BASE-SX,\\\\n1000-BASE-LH, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging, IEEE 802.1AX Link Aggregation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nManagement standards - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v1, v2c, v3\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 854 Telnet\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1155 Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1156 MIB\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1157 SNMP\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1213 SNMP MIB II\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1350 Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 1643 Ethernet MIB\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2030 Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2616 HTTP\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2665 Ethernet-Like Interface Types MIB\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2674 Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges with Traffic Classes, Multicast Filtering,\\\\n\\\\nand Virtual Extensions\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2819 Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIB\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 2863 Interfaces Group MIB\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 3164 Syslog\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 3414 User-Based Security Model (USM) for SNMPv3\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 3418 MIB for SNMP\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 3636 Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 MAUs\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 4741 Base NETCONF protocol\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 4742 NETCONF over SSH\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 6241 NETCONF\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 6242 NETCONF over SSH\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 5277 NETCONF event notifications\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 5717 Partial Lock Remote Procedure Call\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 6243 With-Defaults capability for NETCONF\\\\n\\\\n               - RFC 6020 YANG\\\\n\\\\n               - Cisco private MIBs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance Safety:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9800-80 runs on Cisco IOS XE Software version 16.10.1 or later.

The PEMs are hot-swappable, and replacement of a single PEM can be made without power interruption to\\\\nthe system. All external connections to the PEMs are made from the rear panel of the chassis, and they are removed or inserted\\\\nfrom the rear. The main power switch for the unit is located directly next to the PEMs on the rear of the chassis.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe four data ports can operate in either 10G or 1G mode.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** 10/100-Mbps operation is not supported.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 8.** SFPs supported\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSFP-10G-LR-X\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Cisco IOS XE opens a completely new paradigm in network configuration, operation, and monitoring through network**\\\\nautomation. Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards-based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network device.\\\\nThe various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on a device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco provides\\\\nturnkey solutions such as Plug and Play (PnP) that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n  - **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such as the Cisco Catalyst 9800-40 Wireless Controller support a**\\\\n\\\\nwide range of automation features and provide robust open APIs over Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) using\\\\nYANG data models for external tools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a wireless controller to a**\\\\n\\\\ndestination. The data to be streamed is driven through subscription to a data set in a YANG model. The subscribed data\\\\nset is streamed out to the destination at configured intervals. Additionally, Cisco IOS XE enables the push model, which\\\\nprovides near-real-time monitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n- **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n- **High availability: Stateful switchover with a 1:1 active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services, and**\\\\n\\\\nclients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n- **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) with hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and eliminates the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is\\\\na package that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow\\\\nyou to address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE\\\\nplatform internally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are\\\\nintegrated into the subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n- **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-40 Wireless**\\\\n\\\\nController comes equipped with intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades\\\\ncan now be done in stages, and access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Standby monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in high-availability mode enables monitoring the health of\\\\n\\\\nthe system on a standby controller in a high-availability pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF)\\\\nand CLIs without going through the active controller. For more details refer to the technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is still\\\\n\\\\non. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues uninterrupted. All\\\\naccess point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process.\\\\n\\\\nWith just a click, your network automatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives\\\\nthe new software that is pushed via the active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes\\\\nover your network, while your previously active 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software\\\\nupgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling access point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered\\\\nfashion without impacting any wireless session. This procedure is carried out without any manual intervention\\\\nnatively from the controller and without the need for an external orchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n  - **Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA): ETA is a unique capability for identifying malware in encrypted traffic coming from the**\\\\n\\\\naccess layer. Since more and more traffic is being encrypted, the visibility this feature provides related to threat detection is\\\\ncritical for keeping your network secure at different layers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800-40, these trustworthy systems help assure hardware and software authenticity for supply chain trust\\\\nand strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities include:\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and**\\\\n\\\\nother software are authentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are\\\\nchecked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable**\\\\n\\\\nhardware, mitigating threats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be\\\\nloaded, regardless of a user\\'s privilege level. It provides layered protection against the persistence of\\\\nillicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Cisco Trust Anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution uniquely**\\\\n\\\\nidentifies the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the\\\\nproduct is genuine.\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to**\\\\n\\\\ndetect, locate, mitigate, and contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor\\\\nand detect wireless network anomalies, unauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated\\\\nclassification engine for rogues and aWIPS is built on Cisco DNA Center. A fully integrated stack for\\\\nthe WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, a Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2, and Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides improved detection and security,\\\\nsimplicity, and ease of use, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n  - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of the**\\\\n\\\\nnetwork infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication visibility and control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Next-Generation Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR2): NBAR2 enables advanced application**\\\\n\\\\nclassification techniques, with up to 1400 predefined and well-known application signatures and up to 150 encrypted\\\\napplications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800-40. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype, Office 365,\\\\nMi ft L Ci W b d F b k M th l d d fi d d t fi NBAR2 id\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nperformance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime, Stealthwatch, or\\\\nany compliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service\\\\n\\\\n  - **Superior Quality of Service (QoS): QoS technologies are tools and techniques for managing network resources and are**\\\\n\\\\nconsidered the key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800-40 consists of classification of traffic based on packet data as well as application recognition and\\\\ntraffic control actions such as drop, marking and policing. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent\\\\nplatform-independent and flexible configuration behavior. The 9800-40 also supports policies at two levels of target: BSSID\\\\nas well as client. Policy assignment can be granular down to the client level.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-40 has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using WebUI or the Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n  - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that provides the ability to provision the device, simplify**\\\\n\\\\ndevice deployment and manageability, and enhance the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image. There is no\\\\nneed to enable anything or install any license on the device.

The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X2 MIMO built in the IR829 creates a selfhealing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated access point can serve as both an\\\\naccess point and a client to a wireless mesh network. This combined functionality provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet and cellular. The Cisco ClientLink feature of the access point improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) enables radar detection and avoidance to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. The IR829 concurrently supports both 4G LTE wireless WAN and Cisco dual-radio WLAN backhaul on the same\\\\nplatform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Dual active LTE connectivity. With two LTE modems, the IR829 enables concurrent connectivity to two**\\\\ncellular networks for high reliability, enhanced data throughputs, load balancing, and differentiated\\\\nservices. Applicable for IR829M-2LTE and IR829-2LTE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Security services, such as hardware cryptography, including Cisco’s Next Generation Encryption (https**\\\\n://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/next-generation-cryptography.html) that guarantees high\\\\nperformance for IPsec VPN traffic and firewall. Requires no additional hardware or client software. With\\\\nthese security services, fleet vehicle management and mass transit systems, for example, can intelligently\\\\nredirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web\\\\ntraffic. With this solution, businesses can deploy the market-leading web security solution quickly and\\\\neasily to protect assets from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and\\\\nresources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30**\\\\nmilliseconds or less), WWAN services provide an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services.\\\\nThe single LTE model of the IR829 supports peak data rates of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps\\\\non the uplink. The dual LTE model doubles the throughput by supporting peak data rates of 150 Mbps\\\\non the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink on each of the two cellular links. Actual data speed depends\\\\non the service provider network. With single and dual 4G LTE options, the IR829s offer a flexible,\\\\nredundant cellular connectivity for mission critical services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also\\\\nbe used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or\\\\nvery expensive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIoT gives the transportation industry an opportunity to connect people, improve safety, communicate more effectively, and\\\\nchange transportation centers into community hubs. The IR829 offers the automotive industry - including commercial fleets,\\\\nemergency-response and public safety vehicles, rail, and roadways - standards-based, scalable, and highly secure solutions.\\\\nIR829 meets FirstNet requirements, has passed certification, and supports all FirstNet features.\\\\n\\\\nFleet vehicles\\\\n\\\\nThe IR829 can withstand severe weather and environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, high vibrations, and\\\\nshocks often encountered on buses and trains. The IR829s use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS[®] Software to\\\\nhost networks in motion. Transitioning to different wireless networks is transparent to users and devices (such as laptops, smart\\\\ndevices, sensors and cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the manual intervention of users as\\\\nWAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the IR829 4G LTE routers allow an entire\\\\nmobile network or subnet to stay connected. The dual-radio 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz WLAN on the IR829 can serve as both a client\\\\nand an access-point. Our products also help transit operators effectively track vehicle fleets through built-in GPS systems.\\\\n\\\\nMass transit\\\\n\\\\nPublic-safety personnel can move critical video data and other sensitive information from incident commanders to field officers\\\\nover a secure network, giving public safety agencies and their personnel access to real-time, multimedia data in the field. This\\\\naccess helps agencies increase cost efficiencies, provide better response time, and improve safety and security.\\\\n\\\\nAsset management\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations can now remotely monitor and manage assets by connecting the asset with an IR829 over LTE WAN. The dual\\\\nLTE capability of IR829 enables wireless WAN redundancy, improved coverage, and increased bandwidth for the asset.\\\\nIntegrating with Cisco’s video surveillance solution provides remote surveillance of these assets. Centralized monitoring and\\\\ncontrol of assets using the IR829 helps organizations lower their cost of operations, identify issues remotely, and take meaningful\\\\nactions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of Cisco 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Two serial**\\\\n**interfaces**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Two asynchronous serial interfaces (one RS232 port and one RS232/RS485 port) that can be used with Raw\\\\n\\\\nSocket, Protocol Translation and IOx applications to provide two serial connections to local RTU for SCADA\\\\ntransport and RTU management.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**2 The two SIMs operate in active/backup mode on the single LTE models of the IR829 and active/active mode with each of the two SIMs**\\\\n\\\\n**assigned to a specific cellular radio on the dual LTE models.**\\\\n\\\\n## Integrated WLAN access point: Flexible, high performance\\\\n\\\\nThe integrated WLAN access point in the IR829 routers offers a flexible, highly secure, and scalable platform that can be\\\\n[deployed as part of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network or as a standalone, autonomous solution.

(Figures 2 and 3, respectively). Both models include support for 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 4G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the ISR M2M Gateway footprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where space, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical factors.\\\\n\\\\n For mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide geographic areas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Nonhardened Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.** Hardened Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### A critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 ISR serves as the single, horizontal platform which enhances the Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere, any place” across multiple industries, including banking, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco architecture.\\\\n\\\\n Product Overview\\\\n\\\\n The Cisco 819 Integrated Services Routers support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 LTE standards for 4G LTE. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The Cisco 819 Routers have the following variants:\\\\n\\\\n  - C819HG-4G-V-K9 and C819G-4G-V-K9: Dedicated multimode LTE for Verizon Wireless networks (700MHz band 13); the\\\\n\\\\n#### multimode C819 is backward-compatible with code division multiple access (CDMA) 1x/ EV-DO Rev A: 800 and 1900 MHz\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- C819HG-4G-A-K9 and C819G-4G-A-K9: Multimode LTE for AT&T (700MHz band 17); multimode C819 is backward\\\\n#### compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), high-speed packet access plus (HSPA+): 850, 1900, and 2100 MHz\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - C819HG-4G-G-K9 and C819G-4G-G-K9: Multimode LTE for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band\\\\n\\\\n#### 8), 1800 MHz (band3), 2100 MHz (band 1), or 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; the multimode C819 is backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 900 and 2100 MHz\\\\n\\\\n The Cisco 819 ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no\\\\n\\\\n#### additional hardware or client software, This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, banks, and mobile fleets, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco WAN optimization system consists of WAAS Express (WE) routers and Wide-area Application Engines (WAEs) that\\\\n\\\\n#### work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\n#### switch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\n#### management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\n#### traditional wireline services. The 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 4G LTE WWAN Cisco 819 offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n Business Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\n Businesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n Ability to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 allows an entire mobile network or subnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\n Retail VPN\\\\n\\\\n Retail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 4G LTE wireless WAN option on the Cisco 819 for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\n Managed Services\\\\n\\\\n Service providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security and wireless LAN (WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n Primary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n Table 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n Table 1.

Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network\\\\ndevice. The various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on the device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco Catalyst access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco\\\\nprovides turnkey solutions with Plug and Play (PnP) capabilities that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n - **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series support a wide range of**\\\\n\\\\nautomation features and provide robust open APIs over NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG data models for external\\\\ntools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n - **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a switch to a destination. The data**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmonitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800 Series, these trustworthy systems enable hardware and software authenticity assurance for supply\\\\nchain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities\\\\ninclude:\\\\n\\\\n- **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other software are**\\\\n\\\\nauthentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable hardware, mitigating**\\\\n\\\\nthreats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be loaded, regardless of a user\\'s privilege level. It\\\\nprovides layered protection against the persistence of illicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n- **Cisco Trust Anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution provides hardware authenticity**\\\\n\\\\nassurance to uniquely identify the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the product\\\\nis genuine.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate,**\\\\n\\\\nand contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies,\\\\nunauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated classification engine for rogues and aWIPS is built on Cisco DNA\\\\nCenter. A fully integrated stack for the WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2,\\\\nand Cisco Catalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity, ease of\\\\nuse, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\nResiliency and high availability\\\\n\\\\n - **Stateful Switchover (SSO): Stateful Switchover with an active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services,**\\\\n\\\\nand clients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n - **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) and hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and avoiding the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a\\\\npackage that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you\\\\nto address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform\\\\ninternally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into\\\\nthe subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series comes**\\\\n\\\\nwith intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades can now be done in stages,\\\\nand access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n - Standby Monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in HA mode enables monitoring the health of the system on\\\\n\\\\nstandby controller in an HA pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going\\\\nthrough the active controller. For more details refer technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All access point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process. With just a click, your network\\\\nautomatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives the new software that is pushed via\\\\nthe active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes over your network, while your previously\\\\nactive 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software upgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling\\\\naccess point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered fashion without impacting any wireless session. This\\\\nprocedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from the controller and without the need for an external\\\\norchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS Software FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of**\\\\n\\\\nthe network infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication visibility and control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nencrypted applications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype,\\\\nOffice 365, Microsoft Lync, Cisco WebEx, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure.\\\\nNBAR2 provides the network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application\\\\nusage while helping ensure a quality user experience and securing the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to\\\\nreport application performance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime,\\\\nCisco Stealthwatch, or any compliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service (QoS)\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior QoS: QoS technologies are a set of tools and techniques for managing network resources and are considered**\\\\n\\\\nthe key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9800 Series consists of classification and marking, policing and markdown, and scheduling, shaping, and queuing\\\\nfunctions. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent platform-independent and flexible configuration\\\\nbehavior. The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series also supports 2-level hierarchical or nested policies.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-L has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using the WebUI or Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that enables provisioning of the device, simplifying**\\\\n\\\\ndevice deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image. There is\\\\nno need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-1 configuration and from\\\\nthen on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\\\\n\\\\n## Specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 8.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Table 8.

As organizations are automating and establishing remote operations, Cisco is expanding the capabilities of the Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router (1101-A-K9 only) to meet the connectivity requirements of businesses wherever they operate. Network Advantage license is required. \\\\n\\\\n Cellular communications in the 400-450MHz band, also called 450MHz LTE, have a longer wavelength, lower frequency and lower energy requirements compared to the traditional LTE and 5G. Due to the physical properties of the frequencies, it has benefits of covering a larger geographical area. It has been employed across several parts of Europe for connecting utility grids, maritime and other mission critical networks.\\\\n\\\\n Cisco has partnered with Intelliport, a Hungary based technology provider in developing a module for the IR1101 to meet the market needs. The 450MHz LTE band provides high resiliency and deep indoor signal penetration to connect the Catalyst IR1101 anywhere onsite. Datasheet for the module is available here - https://www.intelliport.hu/dinamic/P-LTE-450%20datasheet%20v1dot0.pdf.\\\\n\\\\n### LoRaWAN modules\\\\n\\\\n###### LoRa is an unlicensed RF physical layer modulation technology that offers long-distance wireless connectivity, excellent power efficiency, very high receiver sensitivity, robust spectrum spreading, and securely encrypted transmissions. LoRaWAN is a MAC (Media Access Control) protocol specification defined by the LoRa Alliance that complements the LoRa physical layer. It is supported by an established ecosystem of LoRaWAN compliant devices that are available from multiple vendors, and which can be certified for interoperability by the LoRa Alliance. The technology is used for a variety of use cases such as water and gas meters, asset trackers, parking sensors and environmental sensors.\\\\n\\\\n Note:  The LoRaWAN module, in combination with the IR1101, enables LoRaWAN gateway functionality (not endpoint functionality). The LoRaWAN module is compatible with IOS XE release 17.10 and later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 12.** 900 and 800 MHz LoRaWAN modules available with the IR1101\\\\n\\\\n**Feature** **Description**\\\\n\\\\n**ISM Band Support** - 900 MHz ISM band: subset of 902 – 928 MHz, depending on country/region\\\\n\\\\n                          - 800 MHz ISM band: subset of 863 – 870 MHz, depending on country/region\\\\n\\\\n                          - 8 uplink channels\\\\n\\\\n**LoRa Technology** - Based on Semtech “Corecell” reference design\\\\n\\\\n**LoRaWAN Specification** - LoRaWAN specification 1.0.x and 1.1 release compliant\\\\n\\\\n                          - US915, EU868, AU915, AS923-x, IN865\\\\n\\\\n                          - Support for Class A, B (Roadmap for Common Packet Forwarder), and C endpoints\\\\n\\\\n**Radio Spectrum Sniffer** - Online scanning of the interference noise on the RF channel\\\\n\\\\n**LTE Coexistence** - 900 MHz Module: More than 40 dB rejection of LTE/NR Band 5/26 uplinks (814 – 849 MHz)\\\\n\\\\n                          - 800 MHz Module: More than 40 dB rejection of LTE/NR Band 20 (832 – 853 MHz) and Band 8\\\\n\\\\n(884 – 915 MHz) uplinks\\\\n\\\\n**Antenna Connectors** - RF Antenna Connector: One external SMA (f) connector\\\\n\\\\n                          - GPS Antenna Connector: One external SMA (f) connector\\\\n\\\\n**Power Consumption** - Typical, radio in receive mode: 1.2 W\\\\n\\\\n                          - Maximum, transmitting at 27 dBm: 3.3 W\\\\n\\\\n**Built-In GPS** - High-sensitivity GNSS module\\\\n\\\\n                          - GPS L1C/A, QZSS L1C/A, and GLONASS L1OF\\\\n\\\\n                          - Time pulse accuracy < 30 ns RMS, < 60 ns 99% of the time (clear sky)\\\\n\\\\n                          - NMEA 0183, Version 4.0\\\\n\\\\n**LEDs** Power LED\\\\n\\\\n                          - Off: Device not powered on\\\\n\\\\n                          - Amber solid: Device power-up is in progress\\\\n\\\\n                          - Green solid: Power on\\\\n\\\\nStatus LED\\\\n\\\\n                          - Off: Device not fully configured\\\\n\\\\n                          - Red solid: Interface error or configuration error encountered\\\\n\\\\n                          - Green solid: Device fully configured; LoRa interface operational\\\\n\\\\n**ACT[2]** Cisco Anti-Counterfeit Technology, 2[nd] Generation\\\\n\\\\n**Receiver Sensitivity** Receiver sensitivity at 10% PER, 125 kHz bandwidth:\\\\n\\\\n**Spreading Factor** **Typical (dBm)**\\\\n\\\\nSF7 -124 -120\\\\n\\\\nSF8 -127 -123\\\\n\\\\nSF9 -130 -126\\\\n\\\\nSF10 -133 -129\\\\n\\\\nSF11 -136 -132\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Description|Col3|Col4|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|ISM Band Support|● 900 MHz ISM band: subset of 902 – 928 MHz, depending on country/region ● 800 MHz ISM band: subset of 863 – 870 MHz, depending on country/region ● 8 uplink channels|||\\\\n|LoRa Technology|● Based on Semtech “Corecell” reference design|||\\\\n|LoRaWAN Specification|● LoRaWAN specification 1.0.x and 1.1 release compliant ● US915, EU868, AU915, AS923-x, IN865 ● Support for Class A, B (Roadmap for Common Packet Forwarder), and C endpoints|||\\\\n|Radio Spectrum Sniffer|● Online scanning of the interference noise on the RF channel|||\\\\n|LTE Coexistence|● 900 MHz Module: More than 40 dB rejection of LTE/NR Band 5/26 uplinks (814 – 849 MHz) ● 800 MHz Module: More than 40 dB rejection of LTE/NR Band 20 (832 – 853 MHz) and Band 8 (884 – 915 MHz) uplinks|||\\\\n|Antenna Connectors|● RF Antenna Connector: One external SMA (f) connector ● GPS Antenna Connector: One external SMA (f) connector|||\\\\n|Power Consumption|● Typical, radio in receive mode: 1.2 W ● Maximum, transmitting at 27 dBm: 3.3 W|||\\\\n|Built-In GPS|● High-sensitivity GNSS module ● GPS L1C/A, QZSS L1C/A, and GLONASS L1OF ● Time pulse accuracy < 30 ns RMS, < 60 ns 99% of the time (clear sky) ● NMEA 0183, Version 4.0|||\\\\n|LEDs|Power LED ● Off: Device not powered on ● Amber solid: Device power-up is in progress ● Green solid: Power on|||\\\\n||Status LED ● Off: Device not fully configured ● Red solid: Interface error or configuration error encountered ● Green solid: Device fully configured; LoRa interface operational|||\\\\n|ACT2|Cisco Anti-Counterfeit Technology, 2nd Generation|||\\\\n||Receiver sensitivity at 10% PER, 125 kHz bandwidth:|||\\\\n||Spreading Factor|Typical (dBm)|Maximum (dBm)|\\\\n||SF7|-124|-120|\\\\n||SF8|-127|-123|\\\\n||SF9|-130|-126|\\\\n||SF10|-133|-129|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Description|Col3|Col4|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n||SF12|-139|-136|\\\\n|Tx Power (max)|27 dBm; Note: The maximum power will vary according to individual country regulations|||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Cisco Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFPs) modules\\\\n\\\\n###### The IR1101 Ethernet SFP module provides connections to other devices.

Whether in a public or private cloud, the Cisco Catalyst**\\\\n\\\\n9800-CL best meets your organization’s needs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Built on a modular operating system, the 9800-CL features open and programmable APIs that enable automation of day-0\\\\n\\\\nto day-N network operations. Model-driven streaming telemetry provides deep insights into the health of your network\\\\n**and clients.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco User Defined Network, a feature available in Cisco DNA Center, allows IT to give end users control of their very own\\\\n\\\\nwireless network partition on a shared network. End users can then remotely and securely deploy their devices on this\\\\nnetwork. Perfect for university dormitories or extended hospital stays, Cisco User Defined Network grants both device\\\\nsecurity and control, allowing each user to choose who can connect to their network.\\\\n\\\\n  - The Wi-Fi 6 readiness dashboard is a new dashboard in the Assurance menu of Cisco DNA Center. It will look through the\\\\n\\\\ninventory of all devices on the network and verify device, software, and client compatibility with the new Wi-Fi 6 standard.\\\\nAfter upgrading, advanced wireless analytics will indicate performance and capacity gains as a result of the Wi-Fi 6\\\\ndeployment. This is an incredible tool that will help your team define where and how the wireless network should be\\\\nupgraded. It will also give you insights into the access point distribution by protocol (802.11 ac/n/abg), wireless airtime\\\\nefficiency by protocol, and granular performance metrics.\\\\n\\\\n  - With Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU), network downtime during a software update or upgrade is a thing of the\\\\n\\\\npast. ISSU is a complete image upgrade and update while the network is still running. The software image—or patch—is\\\\npushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues uninterrupted.

The 9800-CL meets the needs of your branch and campus network deployments.\\\\n\\\\nOpen and programmable\\\\n\\\\nThe controllers are built on the Cisco IOS XE operating system, which offers a rich set of open standards-based programmable\\\\nAPIs and model-driven telemetry that provide an easy way to automate day-0 to day-N network operations.\\\\n\\\\nKey specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** Key specifications\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n*** A high-throughput profile is supported on ESXi and KVM hypervisors only.**\\\\n\\\\n****For traffic with large (1374 bytes) packet size**\\\\n\\\\n*****Cloning from snapshots is not supported**\\\\n\\\\n******vMotion, DRS, Snapshots, and vNIC Teaming not supported when SR-IOV mode is enabled.**\\\\n\\\\n*******Starting 17.8**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco IOS XE opens a completely new paradigm in network configuration, operation, and monitoring through network automation.\\\\nCisco’s automation solution is open, standards-based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network device. The various\\\\nmechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on a device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco provides\\\\nturnkey solutions such as Plug and Play (PnP) that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud**\\\\n\\\\nsupport a wide range of automation features and provide robust open APIs over Network Configuration Protocol\\\\n(NETCONF) using YANG data models for external tools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision\\\\nnetwork resources.\\\\n\\\\n- **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a wireless controller to a destination.**\\\\n\\\\nThe data to be streamed is driven through subscription to a data set in a YANG model. The subscribed data set is\\\\nstreamed out to the destination at configured intervals. Additionally, Cisco IOS XE enables the push model, which provides\\\\nnear-real-time monitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\nAlways on\\\\n\\\\n - **High availability: Stateful switchover with a 1:1 active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services, and**\\\\n\\\\nclients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) with hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and eliminates the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is\\\\na package that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow\\\\nyou to address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE\\\\nplatform internally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are\\\\nintegrated into the subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n- **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless**\\\\n\\\\nController for Cloud comes equipped with intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite\\\\nupgrades can now be done in stages, and access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Standby monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in High-Availability (HA) mode: This enables**\\\\n\\\\nmonitoring of the health of the system on a standby controller in a HA pair using programmatic interfaces\\\\n(NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going through the active controller. For more details refer to technical\\\\ndocumentation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All AP/client sessions are retained during the upgrade process.\\\\n\\\\nWith just a click, your network automatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup Catalyst 9800 controller receives\\\\n\\\\nthe new software that is pushed via the active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active controller and\\\\ntakes over your network while your previously active 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software\\\\nupgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling access-point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered\\\\nfashion, without impacting any wireless session. This procedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from\\\\nthe controller, and without the need for an external orchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n - **Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA): ETA is a unique capability for identifying malware in encrypted traffic coming from the**\\\\n\\\\naccess layer. Since more and more traffic is being encrypted, the visibility this feature provides related to threat detection is\\\\ncritical for keeping your network secure at different layers. This feature is supported on private cloud deployments only.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate,**\\\\n\\\\nand contain any intrusion and threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies,\\\\nunauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new dedicated classification engine for rogue and aWIPS built on Cisco DNA\\\\nCenter. A fully integrated stack for WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave2, and\\\\nCatalyst 9100 Access Points. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity and ease of use,\\\\nand a reduction in false positive alarms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities include:\\\\n\\\\n◦ **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other**\\\\n\\\\nsoftware are authentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of the**\\\\n\\\\nnetwork infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication Visibility and Control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Next-Generation Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR2): NBAR2 enables advanced application**\\\\n\\\\nclassification techniques, with up to 1400 predefined and well-known application signatures and up to 150 encrypted\\\\napplications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype, Office 365,\\\\nMicrosoft Lync, Cisco Webex, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure. NBAR2 provides\\\\nthe network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application usage while helping\\\\nensure a quality user experience and secure the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to report application\\\\nperformance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime, Stealthwatch, or any\\\\ncompliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior Quality of Service (QoS): QoS technologies are tools and techniques for managing network resources and are**\\\\n\\\\nconsidered the key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800-CL consists of classification of traffic based on packet data as well as application recognition and\\\\ntraffic control actions such as dropping, marking and policing. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent\\\\nplatform-independent and flexible configuration behavior. The 9800-CL, also, supports policies at two levels of target:\\\\nBSSID as well as client. Policy assignment can be granular down to the client level.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that provides the ability to provision the device,**\\\\n\\\\nsimplifying device deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image.\\\\nThere is no need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-0 and day-1\\\\nconfiguration and from then on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\\\\n\\\\n### Specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Management standards** - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v1, v2c, v3\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 854 Telnet\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1155 Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1156 MIB\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1157 SNMP\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1213 SNMP MIB II\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1350 Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 1643 Ethernet MIB\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2030 Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2616 HTTP\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2665 Ethernet-Like Interface Types MIB\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2674 Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges with Traffic Classes, Multicast Filtering,\\\\n\\\\nand Virtual Extensions\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2819 Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIB\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 2863 Interfaces Group MIB\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 3164 Syslog\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 3414 User-Based Security Model (USM) for SNMPv3\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 3418 MIB for SNMP\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 3636 Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 MAUs\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 4741 Base NETCONF protocol\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 4742 NETCONF over SSH\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 6241 NETCONF\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 6242 NETCONF over SSH\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 5277 NETCONF event notifications\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 5717 Partial Lock Remote Procedure Call\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 6243 With-Defaults capability for NETCONF\\\\n\\\\n                   - RFC 6020 YANG\\\\n\\\\n                   - Cisco private MIBs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n### Software requirements\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud runs on Cisco IOS XE Software version 16.10.1 or later.

However, in order to connect\\\\nany access points to the controller, Cisco DNA software subscriptions are required. To be entitled to connect to a Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9800 Series controller, each access point requires a Cisco DNA subscription license. An active Cisco DNA license\\\\nprovides embedded Cisco Software Support (SWSS) coverage for access points. To be entitled to Return Materials Authorization\\\\n(RMA) for access point hardware, customers will need Cisco Smart Net Total Care Service. To get Technical Assistance Center\\\\n(TAC) support, and OS upgrades and updates on 9800-CL controllers, customers will need to purchase Cisco Software Support\\\\nService (SWSS).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 4.**\\\\n\\\\nDetermining license requirements for access points connecting to Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers\\\\n\\\\nAPs connecting to Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series controllers have new and simplified software subscription packages.\\\\n\\\\nThey can support both tiers of Cisco DNA software: Cisco DNA Essentials and Cisco DNA Advantage.\\\\n\\\\nCisco DNA software subscriptions provide Cisco innovations on the AP.

Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network\\\\ndevice. The various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on the device lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n - **Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing**\\\\n\\\\nconfiguration files on Cisco Catalyst access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco\\\\nprovides turnkey solutions with Plug and Play (PnP) capabilities that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\\\\n\\\\n - **API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series support a wide range of**\\\\n\\\\nautomation features and provide robust open APIs over NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG data models for external\\\\ntools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\\\\n\\\\n - **Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a switch to a destination. The data**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmonitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\\\\n\\\\n - **Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides**\\\\n\\\\nfixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to\\\\nadd patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9800 Series, these trustworthy systems enable hardware and software authenticity assurance for supply\\\\nchain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities\\\\ninclude:\\\\n\\\\n- **Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other software are**\\\\n\\\\nauthentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Secure Boot: Cisco Secure Boot technology anchors the boot sequence chain of trust to immutable hardware, mitigating**\\\\n\\\\nthreats against a system\\'s foundational state and the software that is to be loaded, regardless of a user\\'s privilege level. It\\\\nprovides layered protection against the persistence of illicitly modified firmware.\\\\n\\\\n- **Cisco Trust Anchor module: A tamper-resistant, strong cryptographic, single-chip solution provides hardware authenticity**\\\\n\\\\nassurance to uniquely identify the product so that its origin can be confirmed to Cisco, providing assurance that the product\\\\nis genuine.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate,**\\\\n\\\\nand contain any intrusion or threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies,\\\\nunauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new, dedicated classification engine for rogues and aWIPS is built on Cisco DNA\\\\nCenter. A fully integrated stack for the WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave 2,\\\\nand Cisco Catalyst 9100 Access Point. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity, ease of\\\\nuse, and reduced false positive alarms.\\\\n\\\\nResiliency and high availability\\\\n\\\\n - **Stateful Switchover (SSO): Stateful Switchover with an active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services,**\\\\n\\\\nand clients always on, even in unplanned events.\\\\n\\\\n - **Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) and hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a**\\\\n\\\\nbug fix without bringing down the entire network and avoiding the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a\\\\npackage that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you\\\\nto address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform\\\\ninternally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into\\\\nthe subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series comes**\\\\n\\\\nwith intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades can now be done in stages,\\\\nand access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\\\\n\\\\n - Standby Monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in HA mode enables monitoring the health of the system on\\\\n\\\\nstandby controller in an HA pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going\\\\nthrough the active controller. For more details refer technical documentation.\\\\n\\\\n - **In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is**\\\\n\\\\nstill on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues\\\\nuninterrupted. All access point and client sessions are retained during the upgrade process. With just a click, your network\\\\nautomatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup 9800 controller receives the new software that is pushed via\\\\nthe active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active and takes over your network, while your previously\\\\nactive 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software upgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling\\\\naccess point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered fashion without impacting any wireless session. This\\\\nprocedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from the controller and without the need for an external\\\\norchestrator or additional licenses.\\\\n\\\\nFlexible NetFlow\\\\n\\\\n - **Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS Software FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of**\\\\n\\\\nthe network infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with\\\\nincreased flexibility and scalability.\\\\n\\\\nApplication visibility and control\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nencrypted applications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype,\\\\nOffice 365, Microsoft Lync, Cisco WebEx, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure.\\\\nNBAR2 provides the network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application\\\\nusage while helping ensure a quality user experience and securing the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to\\\\nreport application performance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime,\\\\nCisco Stealthwatch, or any compliant third-party tool.\\\\n\\\\nQuality of service (QoS)\\\\n\\\\n - **Superior QoS: QoS technologies are a set of tools and techniques for managing network resources and are considered**\\\\n\\\\nthe key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the Cisco\\\\nCatalyst 9800 Series consists of classification and marking, policing and markdown, and scheduling, shaping, and queuing\\\\nfunctions. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent platform-independent and flexible configuration\\\\nbehavior. The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series also supports 2-level hierarchical or nested policies.\\\\n\\\\nSmart operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - **Bluetooth ready: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-L has hardware support to connect a Bluetooth dongle to the controller,**\\\\n\\\\nenabling you to use this wireless interface as a management port. This port functions as an IP management interface and\\\\ncan be used for configuration and troubleshooting using the WebUI or Command-Line Interface (CLI), and to transfer\\\\nimages and configurations.\\\\n\\\\n - **WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that enables provisioning of the device, simplifying**\\\\n\\\\ndevice deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image. There is\\\\nno need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-1 configuration and from\\\\nthen on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\\\\n\\\\n## Specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Table 8.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Table 8.

Connect moving assets or easily extend your network wirelessly wherever you need access.\\\\n\\\\n### Product overview\\\\n\\\\n###### The Catalyst IW9165 Series addresses the growing need for reliable client wireless connectivity to mission- critical applications as organizations automate processes and operations. It comes with two 2×2 radios, features an industrial design, and is packed with advanced features.\\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165 Series supports multiple operating modes:\\\\n\\\\n   - [Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (URWB) software, which delivers high availability, low latency,](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/industrial-wireless/ultra-reliable-wireless-backhaul/index.html)\\\\n\\\\n###### and zero packet loss with seamless handoffs. URWB is ideal for connecting moving assets or extending your network where running fiber isn’t feasible or affordable. \\\\n\\\\n   - Wi-Fi AP mode, to extend Wi-Fi 6/6E to more places where small form factor is important, like inside\\\\n\\\\n###### cabinets, or to easily provide coverage in the outdoors with a compact design.\\\\n\\\\n   - Catalyst IW9165E can also operate as a Wi-Fi client in Workgroup Bridge (WGB) mode, which allows you\\\\n\\\\n###### to connect operation-critical assets to your existing Wi-Fi infrastructure reliably. \\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165 Series is designed to take advantage of the 6 GHz band expansion to deliver a network that is more reliable and secure, with higher throughput, more capacity, and less device interference. Support for the 6 GHz band will be available with a future software upgrade and is subject to approvals and regulations by each country’s regulatory agencies for the use of the 6 GHz spectrum by standard outdoor power devices. Please refer to the Wi-Fi 6E white paper for more details on 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165 Series comes in two models:\\\\n\\\\n Cisco Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Access Point and Wireless Client\\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165E is designed to add ultra-reliable wireless connectivity to moving vehicles and machines. Its compact form factor makes it very simple to integrate into industrial assets. It can operate in WGB, URWB and Wi-Fi AP mode to enable any use case and leverage the existing wireless environment. \\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165E supports WGB mode, which allows it to connect to a Cisco access point infrastructure, and Universal WGB (uWGB) mode, which allows it to connect to a third-party access point infrastructure. Both of these modes help bridge the wired clients that are behind the WGB to the access point on the infrastructure side.\\\\n\\\\n Low power consumption, rugged IP30 design, small form factor, and DIN rail mount capabilities make the Catalyst IW9165E an ideal product operating as a wireless client for automated guided vehicle (AGV) and Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) deployments, or as a Wi-Fi AP to be installed in cabinets and other places where size is a limiting factor. An M12 adapter and rail certifications make the Catalyst IW9165E a preferred choice for onboard train deployments as well.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n###### Figure 1.\\\\n Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Access Point and Wireless Client\\\\n\\\\n Cisco Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point\\\\n\\\\n The Catalyst IW9165D is designed to make wireless backhaul deployment simple. It comes with a built-in directional antenna that enables long-range, high-throughput connectivity anywhere fiber is not an option, so you can create a fixed wireless infrastructure (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and mesh) as well as backhaul traffic from mobile devices along wayside or trackside deployments. The external antenna ports let you quickly extend your network to new places when needed and choose the right antenna based on the use cases and deployment architectures. With heavy-duty IP67 design, the Catalyst IW9165D is certified to operate under wet, dusty, and extreme temperature conditions.\\\\n\\\\n Figure 2.\\\\n Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n### Secure infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n###### Trustworthy systems built with Cisco Trust Anchor technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products.

However, mobile operators today face a significant challenge. Data traffic continues to grow exponentially, and regular network modifications are required to keep customers happy. New devices and applications are also drastically changing the way the network behaves. Competition in the mobile market is fierce, as the typical subscriber has multiple options for mobile service. At the same time, revenues are increasingly under pressure. It is an age-old dilemma - how does one reduce cost and increase revenue?\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome these challenges, operators must build their core networks with three essential attributes: flexibility, intelligence, and scale. A flexible\\\\nnetwork is one that can adapt to frequently changing business models, with the ability to make in-network design modifications without huge capital\\\\nexpenditures. An intelligent network is one that recognizes the myriad of different user behavior patterns, and has the tools in place to allow operators\\\\nto monetize these patterns quickly and transparently. Finally, a scalable network is one that can address the demands of today\\'s mobile network\\\\nrequirements as well as those that will evolve in the future. Data traffic is not just increasing; it is becoming more complex, requiring a scalable and\\\\nflexible solution across all performance parameters - throughput, transactions, bearers, and sessions.\\\\n\\\\nWith all these factors, mobile operators need a mobile packet core solution that they can count on - one that provides efficient evolution to fourthgeneration (4G) technology and small cells. Operators must plan for the `new normal\\' of the mobile internet - elastic, flexible, virtual. This means\\\\nbeing able to harness the right resources (intelligent performance) when you need them - instantaneously. This new normal starts with the intelligent\\\\n\\\\nperformance of the Cisco [®] ASR 5500 Multimedia Core Platform (Figure 1). Cisco ASR 5500 sets a new standard for intelligent performance that\\\\nredefines the economics of the packet core. It is the first mobile platform designed for terabit performance that scales to tens of millions of sessions,\\\\nand supports the transaction rates required to address the signaling surge.\\\\n\\\\n#### Figure 1. Cisco ASR 5500 Multimedia Core Platform\\\\n\\\\n Cisco ASR 5500 Architecture\\\\n\\\\nAs the newest member to the industry-leading Cisco ASR 5000 series, the Cisco ASR 5500 carries forward the existing ASR 5000 benefits of\\\\nflexibility and intelligence, while providing substantial increases in scale and performance. The Cisco ASR 5500 is a high-capacity platform,\\\\nspecifically designed to satisfy the high performance, subscriber counts, and transaction rates of third-generation (3G) and 4G Long-Term Evolution\\\\n(LTE) services plus the emergence of small cells.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco ASR 5500 supports an elastic architecture for mobile functions, in which these functions are based on software, not coupled to hardware.\\\\nThe ASR 5500 harvests system resources and applies them across the entire platform to optimize performance and maximize capital efficiency. This\\\\napproach allows operators to deploy more efficient mobile networks that can support a greater number of concurrent calls, optimize resource usage,\\\\nand deliver enhanced services, while also providing easy scalability.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco ASR 5500 uses the same software and operating system, StarOS, as the Cisco ASR 5000, supporting a consistent set of services across\\\\nplatforms, which results in a significantly lower impact on operations teams. With the Cisco ASR 5000 series, platform decisions are based on\\\\nperformance, not function or software - operators now have multiple options based on size, scope, and scale.\\\\n\\\\n#### Flexibility\\\\n\\\\nAflexible network is one that can adapt to frequentlychanging business models with the abilityto make in network design modifications without\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nAs the Cisco ASR 5500 is based on the same software system as the Cisco ASR 5000, it carries forward the same benefits of flexibility in terms of\\\\nthe various mobile functions that the product can satisfy. A true next-generation core puts the power of network architecture and design in the hands\\\\nof operators, instead of forcing operators to work within the bounds of competitive platform limitations. The Cisco ASR 5500 has the flexibility to meet\\\\nthe individual deployment needs of operators, and allows functions to be shifted to maintain the correct balance as the needs of the network\\\\nchanges. Below are some of the mobile functions possible on the Cisco ASR 5500:\\\\n\\\\n#### • LTE/EPC - Serving Gateway (SGW)\\\\n • LTE/EPC - PDN Gateway (PGW)\\\\n • UMTS/HSPA - Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)\\\\n • CDMA/HRPD/eHRPD - Home Agent (HA)\\\\n\\\\nBecause the network functions required for any of these access technologies can be combined in a single Cisco ASR 5500 platform, operators can\\\\nrealize significant operational savings and a simplified network. The flexibility of the platform helps operators to prepare for next-generation\\\\ntechnologies, such as LTE. As a result, their 3G investment is secure when they migrate to 4G.\\\\n\\\\n#### Intelligence\\\\n\\\\nCisco ASR 5500 contains real-time integrated, session-state intelligence, including deep packet inspection (DPI) from Layer 1 to Layer 7 for all traffic.\\\\nTaking full advantage of this intelligence allows operators to dramatically increase service velocity (by making the intelligence flexibly and virtually\\\\navailable to services), and improve the customer experience, while optimizing the cost of the network. This sets the stage for continued profitability\\\\nwell into the future. The platform interacts with and recognizes all the major elements that make up the multimedia connection-devices, subscribers,\\\\nnetworks, applications, transport mechanisms, location, session-state, and policies-and assists in service-creation velocity by:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Providing a greater degree of information granularity and flexibility for billing, network planning, and usage trend analysis\\\\n • Sharing information with external application servers that perform value-added processing\\\\n • Exploiting user-specific attributes to launch unique applications on a per-subscriber basis\\\\n • Extending mobility management information to non-mobility-aware applications\\\\n • Enabling policy, charging, and quality-of-service (QoS) features\\\\n\\\\nThe integrated intelligence of the Cisco ASR 5500 provides exceptional inline service capabilities, which allow operators to achieve a higher degree\\\\nof optimization, lower operating expenditures, increased service velocity, and higher levels of service assurance, in comparison with solutions that\\\\nrequire external platforms through a variety of advanced applications. Cisco ASR 5500 inline service capabilities include:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Enhanced content charging\\\\n • Stateful firewall protection\\\\n • Application detection and optimization\\\\n • Content filtering\\\\n • Network-based traffic optimization\\\\n • Video pacing\\\\n • Header enrichment\\\\n\\\\nInline services at the network edge increase network scalability through simple distributed service deployment, reduce latency by simplifying the\\\\nnetwork, protect subscriber sessions with powerful security capabilities, and reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) through integration. The Cisco\\\\nASR 5500 employs the latest encryption and security software and firmware for the vital protection of subscriber sessions. Various authentication\\\\nprotocols are used to secure network access to valid subscribers, while IP Security (IPSec) encryption and termination provide a secure and private\\\\nsession.\\\\n\\\\n#### Performance and Scale\\\\n\\\\nThe evolution to flat IP network architectures and the large growth in mobile Internet traffic has a tremendous impact on signaling, throughput, latency,\\\\nand mobility. Traditional platforms maximize either signaling or bearer performance at the cost of the other type of performance.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco ASR 5500 is purpose-built to address the needs of the mobile multimedia market and provide high performance to address growing\\\\nnetwork signaling and user plane demands. The market-proven Cisco ASR 5000 Series reduces the cost per byte for bearer traffic while reducing the\\\\ncost per attached user for signaling traffic. Going forward, mobile networks will require a solution that scales across all performance parameters throughput, transactions, bearers, and sessions.

An integral part of a Cisco AVVID (Architecture for\\\\nVoice, Video and Integrated Data) solution, IP Phone Services provide access to intelligent network applications and dynamic and interactive\\\\ncommunication tools.\\\\n\\\\nMany attempts at personalizing traditional private branch exchange (PBX) solutions are available today. However, these solutions typically use\\\\nproprietary technology and are expensive and complicated. Cisco IP Phone Services deliver customized content to Cisco IP Phones, enhancing\\\\nemployee productivity and unleashing the power of intelligent network applications.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the Cisco IP Phone 7940 and 7960, you can deploy customized client services with which users can interact from the keypad, soft keys, or a\\\\nrocker key and display valuable information. IP Phone Services use a 145x100 pixel-based LCD display on the Cisco IP Phones 7940 and 7960. By\\\\npressing the services button on a Cisco IP Phone 7940 or 7960, a session is initiated and a menu of services that are configured for the phone\\\\nappears. When you select a service from the listing, the phone\\'s display is updated. The following is a list of compelling services that can be supplied\\\\nto the Cisco IP Phones:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Conference room scheduler\\\\n • E-mail and voice-mail messages list\\\\n • Daily and weekly schedule and appointments\\\\n • Personal address book entries\\\\n • Weather reports\\\\n • Stock information\\\\n • Company news\\\\n • Flight status\\\\n • Transit schedules\\\\n\\\\nThe Software Developer Kit (SDK) makes it easier for Web developers to format and deliver content to the phone by providing Web server\\\\ncomponents for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory access, Web proxy, and graphics conversion. It also contains several sample\\\\napplications, which show how to use the various Extensible Markup Language (XML) tags that the phone supports.\\\\n\\\\n**FEATURES**\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco IP Phone Services SDK helps enterprise partners, developers, and customers deliver customized applications. The SDK includes tools,\\\\nsample applications, and documentation.\\\\n\\\\n**Development Tools**\\\\n\\\\nThe SDK includes the following tools:\\\\n\\\\n#### • LDAP Search-provides a COM server object that performs queries on any LDAP-compliant directory server and returns the\\\\n output in the Cisco IP Phones Services XML data format. LDAP Search enables you to search by:\\\\n – Full name\\\\n\\\\n – First name\\\\n\\\\n – Last name\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### – LDAP distinguished name (DN)\\\\n\\\\n – LDAP relative distinguished name (RDN)\\\\n\\\\nLDAP Search also includes sample code, which demonstrates how to use the LDAP search component, and programming notes.\\\\n\\\\n#### • Proxy Server Web Content Retriever (CiscoURLProxy)-provides a COM object that retrieves Web documents from a\\\\n proxy server for processing by the application.\\\\n\\\\n • Graphics Conversion Tools-includes the Dynamic Graphics Image Converter (CIPX), Commercial Graphics Package Plug ins, and Image Viewer.\\\\n – Dynamic Graphics Image Converter (CIPX)-provides a COM server object, which dynamically translates various types of\\\\n graphic image formats, including GIF, BMP, JPG, and PNG, to the Cisco IP Phone (CIP) format for display on the Cisco IP Phones 7940 or 7960.\\\\n\\\\n – Commercial Graphics Package Plug-Ins-enable you to manually modify graphics images using commercial graphics editing\\\\n packages and save the files in the Cisco IP Phone format. Adobe PhotoShop and Paint Shop Pro are supported.\\\\n\\\\n – ImageViewer-provides a Windows application that enables you to view .cip graphic files on your desktop.\\\\n\\\\n**Sample Applications**\\\\n\\\\nThis SDK provides five sample applications:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Calendar-provides a graphical representation of the Gregorian monthly calendar on the Cisco IP Phone 7940 or 7960 LCD. It\\\\n displays a single month at a time, allowing access to the previous and next months, and user-requested months, from the keypad.\\\\n\\\\n • Stock quote-enables you to input stock ticker symbols from the keypad. Information on the current performance of the\\\\n requested stock is displayed on the LCD of the Cisco IP Phone 7940 or 7960.\\\\n\\\\n • Speed dials-enables you to increase the number of speed dials on your IP Phone using the services button.\\\\n • Graphics image converter-uses the CipX ActiveX library in the SDK for converting graphics images to or from the supported\\\\n formats, which include CIP, GIF, BMP, JPG, and PNG.\\\\n\\\\n • LDAP Search COM Server-enables you to retrieve information from a LDAP directory server and send it in the correct XML\\\\n format to the Cisco IP Phone 7940 or 7960.\\\\n\\\\n**Documentation**\\\\n\\\\nThis SDK includes two documents: \\\\\"Cisco IP Phone Services Application Development Notes,\\\\\" and programming guides on the ActiveX components\\\\nthat are included within the Cisco IP Phones.\\\\n\\\\n#### • \\\\\"Cisco IP Phone Services Application Development Notes\\\\\" describe how to develop and deploy new services.

It enables more effective, more secure, more personal communications that directly affect both sales and profitability. It brings\\\\npeople together by enabling a new way of communicating-where your business moves with you, security is everywhere, and information is\\\\nalways available...whenever and wherever it is needed. Cisco Unified Communications is part of an integrated solution that includes network\\\\ninfrastructure, security, mobility, network management products, lifecycle services, flexible deployment and outsourced management\\\\noptions, end-user and partner financing packages, and third-party communications applications.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G fills the communication needs of executive and high-end office environments that conduct moderate telephone\\\\ntraffic. Dedicated voicemail, directories, settings, and services keys are provided to deliver easy access to key features. Illuminated mute and\\\\nspeakerphone keys are provided to give a clear indication of speaker status. A high-resolution, color, touch-sensitive screen provides clear visual\\\\nindication of the calls that are being handled, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) services deliver a rich user experience. The Cisco Unified IP\\\\nPhone 7970G offers numerous important security features plus the choice of IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE), or local power through an\\\\noptional power adaptor while still retaining compatibility with Cisco PoE equipment (Figure 1).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1. Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G**\\\\n\\\\n**Features**\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G is designed to grow with your organization. A dynamic, soft-key driven feature set enables the phone to keep pace\\\\nwith your requirements via regular software upgrades. Moves, adds, and changes are easy: users can simply pick up their phones and move to a\\\\nnew location anywhere on the network. The Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G also provides accessibility features to those with special needs. Tables 17 present the features, specifications, and compliance information of the Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G, Table 8 provides ordering information, and\\\\nTable 9 lists available optional accessories.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1. Features of Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G**\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Description|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Messages|The phone offers direct access to voicemail with a single button touch.|\\\\n|Directories|The phone identifies incoming messages and categorizes them on the screen, allowing users to quickly and effectively return calls using direct dial-back capability.

The pixel display allows for greater flexibility of features and significantly expands the information viewed when using features such as Services, Information, Messages, and Directory. For example, the Directory button can show local- and server-based directory information.|\\\\n|Display|The phone has a large, high-resolution, graphical 12-bit color, touch-sensitive display, with backlighting to enhance its visual appearance (320 x 234 pixels).|\\\\n|Speakerphone, Mute, and Headset buttons|The phone offers high-quality speakerphone technology, including easy-to-use speaker On/Off, Microphone, Mute, and Headset buttons. These buttons are lit when active. For added security, the audible dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) tones are masked when the speakerphone mode is used.|\\\\n|Ethernet switch|The internal 2-port Cisco Ethernet switch allows for a direct connection to a 10/100BASE-T Ethernet network through an RJ-45 interface with single LAN connectivity for both the phone and a colocated PC. The system administrator can designate separate VLANs (802.1Q) for the PC and Cisco Unified IP phones, providing improved security and reliability of voice and data traffic.|\\\\n|Headset port|A dedicated headset port eliminates the need for a separate amplifier when using a headset. This feature allows the handset to remain in its cradle, making headset use simpler.|\\\\n|External speaker and microphone ports|3.5-mm stereo jacks are fitted to the phone for external speakers and an external microphone. The electrical and audio characteristics are similar to those fitted to many modern PCs. However, when connecting externally powered audio equipment to these ports, the phone has no control over electrical signals that may be introduced by this external equipment. For this reason, Cisco can not endorse any external audio equipment that is connected to the phone when it is powered through inline PoE.|\\\\n|Volume Control|The convenient Volume Control button on the phone provides for easy decibel- level adjustments for the speakerphone, handset, headset, and ringer. The handset is hearing aid-compatible (HAC). Additional volume control gain can be achieved using an inline handset amplifier such as Walker Equipment W-10 and CE-100 amplifiers.|\\\\n|Adjustable foot-stand|The phone foot-stand is adjustable from flat to 60 degrees to provide optimum display viewing and comfortable use of all buttons and keys. The foot-stand is keyed to match standard wall-jack configurations for wall mounting. Two optional wall-mount brackets are also offered, as noted later in this document.|\\\\n|Flexible power options|The Cisco Unified IP Phone 7970G supports IEEE 803.af PoE (Class III). In addition, the phone supports Cisco Prestandard Power over Ethernet (PoE), allowing power to be drawn from any of the Cisco Inline Power-capable blades and boxes. When connected to a Cisco PoE device, the phone will use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) to negotiate the power available. The phone can also be powered locally with a power supply (CP-PWR-CUBE-3).|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMultiple ring\\\\ntones\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nbackground images (if available), and select from a large number of unique\\\\nringer sounds through the User Preference menu.

IW9167 series can support 4x4 MIMO and up to four spatial streams. Wi-Fi 6E is Wi-Fi 6 “extended” into the 6 GHz frequency band, allowing the use of additional channels. IW9167 is Wi-Fi 6E ready, subject to approvals and regulations for the use of the 6 GHz spectrum by each country’s regulatory agencies.||\\\\n|Flexible multitechnology support|Two different technologies (Wi-Fi and URWB) provide flexibility to choose a mode based on the use case. Ability to swap images in the field helps you select Wi-Fi, WGB, or URWB operating modes without changing the hardware.||\\\\n|Tri-radio architecture|IW9167E ● 2.4 GHz 4x4 radio: 20-MHz channels ● 5 GHz 4x4 radio: 20, 40, 80 MHz channels ● 5/6* GHz 4x4 radio: 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channels|IW9167I ● 2.4 GHz 4x4 radio: 20-MHz channels ● 5 GHz 4x4 radio: 20, 40, 80 MHz channels ● 6* GHz 4x4 radio: 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channels|\\\\n|Multigigabit Ethernet|Dual Multigigabit Ethernet supports speeds up to 5 Gbps.||\\\\n|Smart AP† ¥|Smart AP causes the access point to change its power consumption to reflect its current client load. An access point will typically operate on the radios provided to it regardless of how many clients are connected. With Smart AP, if the number of clients is small enough, the access point will automatically reduce the radio stream count, saving power.||\\\\n|Band steering¥ †|Enhanced to help clients that are 6 GHz capable to leave the 5 GHz radio and connect to the 6 GHz one. Wi-Fi 6E clients are automatically directed to connect to the 6 GHz radio to take advantage of the benefits that the radio offers and free up the 2.4- and 5 GHz radios for legacy clients. IW9167 is Wi-Fi 6E ready, subject to approvals and regulations for the use of the 6 GHz spectrum by each countries’ regulatory agencies||\\\\n|Uplink/downlink OFDMA¥|Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into smaller frequency allocations called Resource Units (RUs), which can be assigned to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency.||\\\\n|Uplink/downlink MU-MIMO technology¥|Supporting four spatial streams, Multiuser Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) enables access points to split spatial streams between client devices to maximize throughput.||\\\\n|BSS coloring¥|Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allows the access points and their clients to differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.||\\\\n|Target Wake Time¥|Target Wake Time (TWT) allows the client to stay asleep and to wake up only at prescheduled (target) times to exchange data with the access point. This offers significant energy savings for battery-operated devices, up to three to four times the savings achieved by 802.11n and 802.11ac.||\\\\n|Intelligent Capture¥|Intelligent Capture probes the network and provides Cisco DNA Center with deep analysis. The software can track more than 240 anomalies and instantaneously review all packets on demand, emulating the onsite network administrator. Intelligent Capture allows for more informed decisions on your wireless networks.||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Bluetooth 5†|The integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 radio enables location-based use cases such as asset tracking, wayfinding, and analytics.|\\\\n|Scanning radio†|Dedicated radio for monitoring air space to perform advanced RF spectrum analysis and deliver features such as Cisco CleanAir®, Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS), etc.|\\\\n|GNSS|A built-in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver provides coordinates to track the location of the access point.|\\\\n|M12 adapter|M12 adapter accessories give the flexibility to convert Ethernet and power interfaces on the base unit into M12 interfaces while retaining all the certifications.|\\\\n|Multipath operations†¢|Multipath Operations (MPO) can enhance reliability by sending duplicate copies of packets across multiple wireless paths.|\\\\n|WorkGroup Bridge (WGB)|Provides wireless connectivity to a lightweight access point infrastructure on behalf of wired clients that are connected via Ethernet behind the WGB access point.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n† Available with a future software upgrade.\\\\n\\\\n¥ Available only in Wi-Fi mode.\\\\n\\\\n¢ Available only in URWB mode.\\\\n\\\\n- 6 GHz subject to approval by country’s regulatory agency.\\\\n\\\\n### Prominent features\\\\n\\\\n###### Get reliable wireless connectivity for your mission-critical applications\\\\n\\\\n As you automate your processes and operations to increase safety and productivity, you also need to improve your situational awareness to control your systems.

Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports enterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco\\\\n819HGW platforms concurrently support both 3G for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual radio WLAN on the same platform as\\\\nshown in Figure 2. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s\\\\nCleanAir technology, to create a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated\\\\nAP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices\\\\nand dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Figure 2 shows the 819 ISR with integrated 3G and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access\\\\n[Point is available at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Non-hardened Cisco 819GW Integrated Services Router with 3G and Wi-Fi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 ISR serves as the single, horizontal platform which enhances\\\\nthe Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere, any place” across multiple industries, including banking, retail, healthcare,\\\\nmanufacturing, government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a\\\\nrelatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco architecture..\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISRs for M2M applications supports 3G High-Speed Packet Access Plus [HSPA+] and Evolution Data Optimized\\\\n\\\\n[EV-DO Rev A]), enabling up to 3.7G speeds. They are backward compatible with High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Universal\\\\nMobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service\\\\n(GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 819 3G includes an integrated WLAN access point and has two hardened and unhardened variants:\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership\\\\n\\\\nProject (3GPP), and they support HSPA+ (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access [HSUPA] and High-Speed Downlink Packet\\\\nAccess [HSDPA]), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A and Rev 0 and\\\\n\\\\n1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no\\\\n\\\\nadditional hardware or client software, This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, banks, and mobile\\\\nfleets, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies\\\\nover user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video\\\\napplications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\ntraditional wire line services. Third- and fourth-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G\\\\nand 4G LTE WWAN can be used as a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications.\\\\nThe 3G and 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband\\\\nservices are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support\\\\nfor wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\n\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch\\\\noffice or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of\\\\nbroadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that\\\\ncan be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE\\\\nwireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The\\\\nCisco 819 enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 uses standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ncommunicate with either a localized WLAN network as in a bus or train dock or communicate with a city-wide WLAN deployment\\\\nwhen in motion.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G, 3.5G or 3.7G (4G?) wireless WAN\\\\noption on the Cisco 819 for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other\\\\ndata security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security\\\\nand wireless LAN (WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities\\\\nsuch as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote\\\\nmanagement and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits of Cisco 819\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Smallest Cisco ISR in both Hardened and Non-hardened Form Factors||\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATM machines, kiosks, small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, telemetry, etc. and across all industries. ● Hardened models extend the ISR footprint into deployments wherein the router is exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, dust, splash water, shock and vibration..|\\\\n|Hardened Router Industrial- grade components|● The hardened router supports extended temperature ranges from –13 to 140ºF (–25 to 60ºC). ● Meets 95 percent of the Non-Condensing Humidity Requirements, IP 41 per IEC 60529 for Vertical Falling Water and Pollution 3 for Dust.

This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for\\\\nexample, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user\\\\nweb traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users\\\\nfrom web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area\\\\n\\\\nApplication Engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications\\\\nattempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and\\\\nthe destination server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. Quality-of-service (QoS) features are included for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n- 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less),\\\\n\\\\nWWAN services are an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average\\\\ndata rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink.\\\\nActual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs offer a\\\\nprimary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G\\\\nLTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either\\\\nnot available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our\\\\nwide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE multiple bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple bearer QoS. Detailed**\\\\n\\\\ninformation on the bearer is part of show CLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and\\\\nrequires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary**\\\\n\\\\nimplementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at\\\\nthe service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this\\\\nservice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can**\\\\n\\\\nbe integrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN Search): UE presents end user with available PLMN search manually. UE can**\\\\n\\\\noptimize PLMN search procedure using stored information such as RF carriers and cell parameters.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition\\\\nto different wireless networks is transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance\\\\ncameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In\\\\naddition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile network or\\\\nsubnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated businessclass security services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G LTE MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional\\\\nmake remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Features|Benefits|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Smallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor||\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATM machines, kiosks, small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries. ● Hardened models extend the ISR footprint into deployments wherein the router is exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, dust, splash water, shock and vibration.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened router\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and\\\\n\\\\noffers both AC and DC power options allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\n\\\\n- The hardened router supports extended temperature ranges from –13 to 140ºF (–25 to 60ºC).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Meets 95 percent of the Non-Condensing Humidity Requirements, IP 41 per IEC 60529 for Vertical Falling Water\\\\n\\\\nand Pollution 3 for Dust.

Transparently integrated into the enterprise-class\\\\nfeature set available on the Cisco 880 Series, 3G, and WiFi wireless connectivity allows for rapid installation, deployment\\\\nflexibility, and resilient mobile broadband backhaul for primary, WAN backup, and WiFi LAN.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nCisco 880 Series Integrated Services Routers are the next generation of fixed-configuration routers that provide collaborative\\\\nbusiness solutions for secure data communication to small businesses and enterprise teleworkers. The embedded 3G wireless\\\\non these routers offers a cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure backup solution. With data rates exceeding T1\\\\nspeeds, 3G wireless can be used for primary WAN connectivity in locations where wire-line services such as DSL and ISDN are\\\\nnot available or are too expensive to deploy.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Routers support the latest 3G standards (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access\\\\n\\\\n[HSPA+] and Evolved Data Optimized Revision A [EV-DO Rev A]) and are backward-compatible with High-Speed Packet Access\\\\n(HSPA), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), General\\\\nPacket Radio Service (GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 880G Series has two variants (refer to Table 1 for part\\\\nnumbers):\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership\\\\n\\\\nProject (3GPP), and they support 3.7G HSPA+, 3.5G HSPA (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access HSPA+/HSPA]), UMTS,\\\\nEDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A/Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to 3G wireless WAN, the Cisco 880G Series offers additional WAN options such as Next-Generation xDSL and Fast\\\\nEthernet WAN interface, a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed switch with VLAN support and the latest 802.11n WLAN*\\\\ncapability with dual radio. The Cisco 880 Series provides the performance required for concurrent services, including firewall,\\\\nintrusion prevention, content filtering, and encryption for VPNs; and quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and\\\\nvideo applications. In addition, Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and\\\\ndeployment. Centralized management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at\\\\nthe remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nThe dual 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO inbuilt Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 880(G)W, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology,\\\\nIndustry’s first to create a self-healing, self-optimizing wireless network. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the Cisco AP\\\\ncan serve both as an AP and as a client to a wireless mesh network concurrently: Hence providing another source for WAN\\\\ndiversity along with GE interface, cellular. Additionally, the ClientLink feature on the AP improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and the capability to do dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allows detecting and avoiding interfering with radar\\\\nsignals to comply with regulatory domains.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series Wireless Integrated Services Routers with Embedded 3G Wireless\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire-line services. Third-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN\\\\nspeeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21.1 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. You can use the 3G WWAN\\\\nas a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. You can also use the 3G WWAN data\\\\nservices as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services.\\\\n\\\\nSmall Remote Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series connects users in small remote offices, such as those for insurance agents, lawyers, or sales, to the main\\\\noffice. You can use the integrated 3G wireless backup option for added reliability when the primary broadband link fails, or as the\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G,\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow you to connect an IP\\\\nphone to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if you use wireless connectivity, the connection will be secure. (Refer to Cisco Business-Ready Teleworker\\\\n[Solutions for more information, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo.)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G wireless option on the Cisco 880G\\\\nSeries for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry (PCI) and other data\\\\nsecurity requirements. Then they can add multiple devices and applications to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and also incorporate optional WLAN support to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 880G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small to medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and\\\\nprovisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nKey Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n  - Embedded cellular modem with 3.7G HSPA+ Release 7: The new 3GPP HSPA+ Release 7 supporting 21.1 Mbps on\\\\n\\\\ndownlink and 5.76 Mbps on uplink is capable of demanding multimedia applications such as large files data transfer and\\\\nvideo streaming.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Embedded cellular modem with Short Message Service (SMS) and Global Positioning System (GPS): The router supports a\\\\n\\\\nnew standalone GPS feature, a native SMS (send and receive) gateway, remotely initiated data call-back using SMS, and\\\\n3G WWAN MIB persistence with more than 300 MIB objects.\\\\n\\\\n- Dual Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) support for HSPA+/HSPA platforms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Embedded 3G WWAN broadband: With the 3G WWAN modem embedded into the router, you gain the benefit of simplified\\\\n\\\\ninstallation and management. In addition, the Cisco 3G WWAN modems are tightly integrated and embedded with Cisco\\\\nintegrated services routers, which run the industry-leading Cisco IOS® Software, giving you access to all the advanced\\\\nfeatures of Cisco IOS Software such as QoS intelligent network queuing and robust security Utilizing common and\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nNext generation Cisco 880G WWAN product family: The Cisco 880 3G router has a new chassis design with improved air\\\\n\\\\nflow, a received-signal-strength-indication (RSSI) LED status bar, and a 3G service LED with no moving parts (fanless on\\\\nCisco 881 and 880 WLAN Series models) while maintaining the same form factor. The routers have common and built-in\\\\nTNC connectors for external MAIN, diversity, GPS, cable, and antenna accessories.\\\\n\\\\n- Short installation time: Businesses sometimes wait for weeks or months to get data circuits installed at new locations. For\\\\n\\\\ntemporary or seasonal sites, wireless data services allow instant connectivity anywhere there is cellular coverage, and\\\\nrapid deployment allows you to quickly set up networks with WAN connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Network resiliency through WAN diversity: WAN connectivity is crucial to the functioning of your business, and any downtime\\\\n\\\\nmeans a loss of productivity and lost opportunity. Staying connected and operational during a network outage can be vital.\\\\nA wireless connection for backup to a remote site provides protection against line outages and an additional level of\\\\nredundancy because the 3G WWAN infrastructure is often served by separate facilities, providing redundancy for the\\\\nentire local loop.\\\\n\\\\n- Reduced cost: The emerging 3G WWAN cellular data service plans are competitively priced with existing wire-line services\\\\n\\\\n(ISDN, DSL, and cable). 3G WWAN solutions also allow you to consolidate your service providers across large\\\\ngeographical areas instead of having service contracts with multiple service providers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Portability: You can easily relocate the Cisco 880 with 3G WWAN wherever coverage is available.\\\\n\\\\n- Performance: With increasing data usage and the proliferation of web-based applications at remote sites, there is an\\\\n\\\\nincreasing need for high-speed (broadband) data connections to run mission-critical applications at these sites. Thirdgeneration WWAN services promise low-latency links at speeds exceeding T1 connections, allowing you to send and\\\\nreceive more mission-critical data across the WAN in backup scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Building on the Cisco Aironet heritage of RF excellence, the AP 802 Series delivers industry-leading performance for\\\\n\\\\n[secure and reliable wireless connections.

Transparently integrated into the enterprise-class feature set available on the Cisco 880 Series, 3G wireless connectivity\\\\nallows rapid installation, deployment flexibility, and resilient WAN backup.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nCisco 880 Series Integrated Services Routers are the next generation of fixed-configuration routers that provide collaborative\\\\nbusiness solutions for secure data communication to small businesses and enterprise teleworkers. The 3G wireless option\\\\navailable on these routers offers a cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure backup solution. With data rates\\\\napproaching T1 speeds, 3G wireless can be used for primary WAN connectivity in locations where wireline services such as DSL\\\\nand ISDN are not available or are too expensive to deploy.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Routers support the latest 3G standards (High-Speed Packet Access [HSPA] and\\\\nEV-DO Rev A) and are backward-compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), Enhanced Data Rates\\\\nfor Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 880G Series has two\\\\nvariants (refer to Table 1 for part numbers):\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on 3GPP, and they support HSPA (High\\\\nSpeed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A/Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to 3G wireless WAN, the Cisco 880G Series offers additional WAN options such as xDSL and Fast Ethernet WAN\\\\ninterface, a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed switch with VLAN support and the latest 802.11n WLAN capability. The Cisco\\\\n880 Series provides the performance required for concurrent services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, content filtering,\\\\nand encryption for VPNs; and quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications. In addition, Cisco\\\\nConfiguration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management\\\\ncapabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series 3G Wireless Integrated Services Routers\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire line services. 3G WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with\\\\ntheoretical limits in excess of 7 Mbps on the downlink and 5 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G WWAN can be use as a primary link for\\\\nsites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. The 3G WWAN data services can also be use as a costeffective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these\\\\nperformance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng p p y p y\\\\n\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow an IP phone to be\\\\nconnected to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if wireless connectivity is to be used, the connection will be secure. (Refer to Cisco Business-Ready Teleworker\\\\n[Solutions for more information, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G wireless option on the Cisco 880G\\\\nSeries for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry (PCI) and other data\\\\nsecurity requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and also incorporate optional WLAN support to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 880G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small to medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and\\\\nprovisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nKey Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n  - **Integrated 3G WWAN broadband: With the 3G WWAN modem integrated into the router, you gain the benefit of**\\\\n\\\\nsimplified installation and management. In addition, the Cisco 3G WWAN are tightly integrated with Cisco integrated\\\\nservices routers, which run the industry-leading Cisco IOS® Software, giving you access to all the advanced features of\\\\nCisco IOS Software such as quality of service (QoS), intelligent network queuing, and robust security.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Short installation time: Businesses sometimes wait for weeks or months to get data circuits installed at new locations. For**\\\\n\\\\ntemporary or seasonal sites, wireless data services allow instant connectivity anywhere there is cellular coverage, and\\\\nrapid deployment allows you to quickly set up networks with WAN connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n- **Network resiliency through WAN diversity: WAN connectivity is crucial to the functioning of your business, and any**\\\\n\\\\ndowntime means a loss of productivity and lost opportunity. Staying connected and operational during a network outage\\\\ncan be vital. A wireless connection for backup to a remote site provides protection against line outages and an additional\\\\nlevel of redundancy because the 3G WWAN infrastructure is often served by separate facilities, providing redundancy for\\\\nthe entire local loop.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Reduced cost: The emerging 3G WWAN cellular data service plans are competitively priced with existing wireline services**\\\\n\\\\n(ISDN, DSL, and cable). 3G WWAN solutions also allow you to consolidate your service providers across large\\\\ngeographical areas instead of having service contracts with multiple service providers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Portability: Cisco 880 with 3G WWAN can be easily relocate wherever coverage is available.**\\\\n\\\\n  - **Performance: With increasing data usage and the proliferation of web-based applications at remote sites, there is an**\\\\n\\\\nincreasing need for high-speed (broadband) data connections to run mission-critical applications at these sites. 3G WWAN\\\\nservices promise low-latency links at speeds approaching T1 connections, allowing you to send and receive more missioncritical data across the WAN in backup scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Specifications\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 provides 3G specifications for the Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Product Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|3G modem form factor|PCI Express card (included with the router)|\\\\n|Programming interfaces|Cisco IOS Software CLI|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|Col3|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|Wireless technologies supported (performance and throughput)|PCEX-3G-HSPA-G ● HSPA: 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz (forward link up to 7.2 Mbps;

They are rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and secure, and are designed specifically for machine-to-machine\\\\n(M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications include small business, financial, healthcare, and retail. Fully\\\\nintegrated with Cisco IOS Software, the 819 4G LTE ISRs deliver enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice,\\\\nand video communications, to stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. These ISRs are the industry\\\\nleader in providing enterprise-grade wired-line-like functionality such as QoS for cellular, Multi-VRF, advanced VPN, and unified\\\\ncommunications solutions over LTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Non-Hardened 4G LTE 2.5 M2M ISR with Wi-Fi\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs serve as the single horizontal platform that\\\\nenhances the Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere” across multiple industries, including small business, small remote\\\\nbranch, banking, retail, healthcare, and government. They also provide the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to\\\\nsmall branch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco\\\\narchitecture.\\\\n\\\\nCisco IOS Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide geographic areas.\\\\nAdditionally, the 819 ISRs have enterprise-class built-in wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The 819 platforms concurrently support\\\\nboth Fourth-Generation Long-Term Wireless (4G LTE) for wireless WAN (WWAN) backhaul and Cisco dual-radio WLAN on the\\\\nsame platform. A Cisco Aironet® 3500 Series Access Point is integrated into the ISRs, providing 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 multipleinput/multiple-output (MIMO). The access point includes Cisco CleanAir® technology to create a self-healing, self-optimizing\\\\nWLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radios, the integrated access point can serve both as an access point and as a\\\\nclient to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity, along with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and\\\\ncellular. The access point’s ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices, and dynamic frequency\\\\n\\\\nl ti (DFS) ll it t d t t d id i t f ith d i l t l ith l t d i M i f ti\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 9 Category 3 LTE\\\\nstandards.

With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services\\\\n\\\\nare an ideal way to supplement traditional wired-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed\\\\ndepends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running\\\\ncomprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be\\\\nused as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface\\\\nalternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN (packet data networks): This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Names) APN so**\\\\n\\\\nthat Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate traffic. (Available Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The 819 ISRs support 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on**\\\\n\\\\nthe bearer is part of the “show” command, SNMP-MIBs. etc. A service provider is required to launch this service. (Available\\\\nQ4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: The 819 ISRs support Multi Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF) for cellular network. Multi-VRF is**\\\\n\\\\na Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway\\\\n(PGW) as the headend at the service provider’s network. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise-grade unified communication solutions over LTE: The 819 ISRs support voice and video and can be**\\\\n\\\\nintegrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Ability to Host Networks in Motion**\\\\n\\\\nThe 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transitions to\\\\ndifferent wireless networks are transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras),\\\\nand applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Retail VPN**\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the 819 4G LTE\\\\nISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\n**Managed Services**\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small and medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make\\\\nremote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n**Primary Features and Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Features** **Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nSmallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor\\\\n\\\\nSingle platform  - This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATMs, kiosks,\\\\nfor multiple small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries.\\\\napplications\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened  - Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and offers\\\\nrouter both AC and DC power options, allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\nLightweight,  - Can be deployed in many different environments where space, heat dissipation, and low power consumption are critical\\\\ncompact size factors.\\\\nwith low power\\\\nconsumption\\\\n\\\\nIncreased  - Performance allows customers to take advantage of broadband network speeds while running highly secure, concurrent\\\\nperformance data, voice, video, and wireless services.\\\\nto run\\\\nconcurrent\\\\nservices\\\\n\\\\nEnhanced  - An integrated stateful and application inspection firewall provides network perimeter security and high-speed IP Security\\\\nsecurity (IPsec); Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption offer data privacy\\\\n\\\\nover the Internet.\\\\n\\\\n         - Intrusion prevention enforces security policies in a larger enterprise or service provider network.\\\\n\\\\n         - Content filtering offers category-based URL classification and blocking, thus providing increased productivity and better\\\\n\\\\nuse of company resources.\\\\n\\\\n         - ScanSafe web security and filtering solution requires no additional hardware or client software.

The Cisco 890G Series ISRs provide quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management\\\\n\\\\ncapabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - WWAN services, offering enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 ms or less)—an ideal way to supplement traditional wired-line\\\\n\\\\nservices. The 4G LTE WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits\\\\nof 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G\\\\nLTE data rates, the WWAN offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including\\\\nvoice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband\\\\nservices are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless\\\\nto our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity,\\\\nwhich is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up\\\\ncomprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services or the need to lay down the\\\\nlines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet the needs and price points of the business\\\\ncustomer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of\\\\nthe local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 890G Series helps businesses stay productive during service provider downtime or a network\\\\nfailure with Cisco Intelligent WAN (IWAN) diversity.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 890G Series uses standards-based mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transitions to different\\\\nwireless networks are transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications\\\\nmaintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device\\\\nto stay connected, the 890G Series allows an entire mobile network or subnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 4G LTE WWAN option on the 890G Series for lowcost broadband access, with the security required to comply with payment card industry (PCI) and other data security requirements. Multiple\\\\ndevices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable secure\\\\nmobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers (VARs) can use the 890G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security\\\\nservices for small and medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities, such as Simple Network Management Protocol\\\\n(SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional, make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple packet data networks: This feature allows configuration of multiple active access point names so that Internet traffic can be**\\\\n\\\\nkept separate from corporate traffic.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The 890G Series supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the**\\\\n\\\\nbearer is part of the “show” command, SNMP-MIBs, etc. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF) for cellular: 4G LTE 2.5 now supports Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a**\\\\n\\\\nCisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway (PGW) as the\\\\nheadend at the service provider’s network. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise-grade unified communications solutions over LTE: The 890G Series supports voice and video and can be integrated**\\\\n\\\\nwith Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN Search): User equipment (UE) presents the end user with available PLMN search manually.

It delivers a better experience in typical environments with more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video; high-density, high-definition collaboration apps; all- wireless offices; and the Internet of Things (IoT). Wi-Fi 6E is Wi-Fi 6 “extended” into the 6GHz frequency band. XOR radio The dual-band XOR radio in the Catalyst 9166 Series enables shifting capacity between 6GHz and a secondary 5GHz radio. Environmental These built-in sensors measure air quality (Total Volatile Organic Compounds [TVOC]), temperature, sensors and humidity, and help ensure a safe working environment, avoiding the need to install an overlay of difficult-to-manage independent sensors. Zero Wait DFS Allows for continuous monitoring of DFS channels for radar events thus enabling faster channel changes when needed. This enables RRM to minimize client distribution and maximize operational readiness. (Available Fall 2023) AP power AP Power optimizations (AP Power save mode) allows the access point to reduce its power optimizations consumption by e.g. shutting off radios during off-hours and weekends – whilst still being smart (AP Power Save enough to re-engage all features should they be needed. This both saves power and reduces the Mode) carbon footprint of running a wireless network. CleanAir Pro CleanAir Pro applies Cisco’s industry leading RF Interference detection and classification to the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands. Client steering Enhanced to help clients that are 6GHz capable to leave the 5GHz radio and connect to the 6GHz radio. Wi-Fi 6E clients are automatically directed to connect to the 6GHz radio to take advantage of the benefits it offers and free up the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios for legacy clients. Uplink/downlink Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into OFDMA smaller frequency allocations called Resource Units (RUs), which can be assigned to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency. Uplink/downlink Supporting the highest number with 12 spatial streams, MultiUser Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU- MU-MIMO MIMO) enables the access points to split spatial streams between client devices to maximize technology throughput. BSS coloring Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allow the access points and their clients to differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions. Target Wake Target Wake Time (TWT) allows the client to stay asleep and to wake up only at prescheduled Time (target) times to exchange data with the access point. This offers significant energy savings for battery-operated devices, up to three to four times the savings achieved by 802.11n and 802.11ac.||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[For more details about Catalyst 9166 Series feature support, see Cisco\\'s Feature Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/feature-matrix/ap-feature-matrix.html)\\\\n\\\\n## Secure infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n**Trustworthy systems built with Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products.**\\\\nWith the Cisco Catalyst 9166 Access Points, these technologies enable assurance of hardware and software authenticity for\\\\nsupply chain trust and strong defense against man-in-the-middle attacks that compromise software and firmware.

It delivers a better experience in typical environments with more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video; high-density, high-definition collaboration apps; all- wireless offices; and the Internet of Things (IoT). Wi-Fi 6E is Wi-Fi 6 “extended” into the 6-GHz frequency band. AP power AP Power Save mode allows the access point to reduce its power consumption by shutting off radios optimizations during off-hours and weekends – while still being smart enough to reengage all features should they (AP Power Save be needed. This both saves power and reduces the carbon footprint of running a wireless network. mode) ® CleanAir Pro Cisco CleanAir Pro applies Cisco’s industry-leading RF interference detection and classification to the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands. Client steering Client steering helps clients that are 6-GHz capable leave the 5-GHz radio and connect to the 6-GHz radio. Wi-Fi 6E clients are automatically directed to connect to the 6-GHz radio to take advantage of the benefits it offers and free up the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz radios for legacy clients. Uplink/downlink Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into OFDMA smaller frequency allocations called resource units (RUs), which can be assigned to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency. Uplink/downlink Supporting the highest number with 6 spatial streams, multiuser multiple input, multiple output (MU- MU-MIMO MIMO) enables the access points to split spatial streams between client devices to maximize technology throughput. BSS coloring Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allow the access points and their clients to differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[For more details about Catalyst 9163E feature support, see Cisco\\'s Feature Matrix.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/feature-matrix/ap-feature-matrix.html)\\\\n\\\\n## Secure infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n**Trustworthy systems built with Cisco[®] Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products.**\\\\nWith the Cisco Catalyst 9163E Access Point, these technologies enable assurance of hardware and software authenticity for\\\\nsupply chain trust and strong defense against man-in-the-middle attacks that compromise software and firmware.

Supported on the Cisco® ASR 5000, the GGSN delivers exceptional throughput, call transaction rates, and\\\\npacket processing, along with significant memory resources. With its subscriber and network intelligence, reliability, and availability, the\\\\nGGSN allows mobile operators to focus on building high-margin revenue streams without worrying about the packet core.\\\\n\\\\nCisco’s GGSN acts as the gateway between the packet core and the external packet- or IP-based network, such as the Internet. Located\\\\nat the heart of the mobile packet core network, the GGSN plays a critical role in policy enforcement, network protection, security, quality\\\\nof service (QoS) enforcement, and interaction with charging and billing systems. It can also be combined with Cisco SGSN Serving GPRS\\\\nSupport Node on a single platform to maximize efficiency and flexibility, reduce latency, and simplify network architecture.\\\\n\\\\nNetwork Migration\\\\n\\\\nCisco’s GGSN supports major standards for deployment in GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/WCDMA/HSPA networks. With simple software upgrades,\\\\nCisco’s GGSN can support present and future 3GPP technologies to protect your investments as your network evolves to support Long\\\\nTerm Evolution (LTE)/Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and multi-access requirements (Wi-Fi, femtocell, etc.).\\\\n\\\\nIn-line Services\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco ASR 5000 platform features the unique capability to deploy services “in-line,” meaning the services are integrated into the\\\\nbearer traffic plane at the edge of the packet core network. This capability provides in-depth session awareness that allows network\\\\nmanagement on a per-subscriber basis and deployment of content-aware applications. Tasks are performed without introducing latency,\\\\nsession interruption, or other kinds of signal degradation.\\\\n\\\\nCisco’s In-line Services use deep packet inspection and intelligent traffic steering to offer the following:\\\\n\\\\n  - Enhanced traffic monitoring, metering, and charging (interaction with standard RADIUS and GPRS Tunneling Protocol [GTP]\\\\n\\\\ncharging and billing systems)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Application detection and optimization for peer-to-peer (P2P) detection and control\\\\n\\\\n- Network-based traffic optimization to achieve QoS based on volume, usage, time-of-day, and traffic type\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Stateful firewall\\\\n\\\\n  - Content filtering for parental control, blocked/allowed listing\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1 shows how Cisco’s GGSN delivers enhanced voice, data, and multimedia services for GPRS/UMTS networks.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco GGSN as the Service Delivery Gateway\\\\n\\\\nFeatures and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nIn depth session awareness allows network management on per subscriber basis and deployment of content aware applications\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n  - Can be combined with SGSN on a single platform to maximize efficiency and flexibility, reduce latency, and simplify network\\\\n\\\\narchitecture\\\\n\\\\n  - High-value In-line Services increase revenue opportunities and network efficiency\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** GGSN Features\\\\n\\\\n**Description** **Specification**\\\\n\\\\nInterfaces  - Gigabit Ethernet\\\\n\\\\n                     - Fast Ethernet\\\\n\\\\nAuthentication, authorization, and accounting  - RADIUS authentication\\\\n\\\\n                     - RADIUS and GPRS Transparent Tunneling Protocol (GTTP) accounting\\\\n\\\\nConnectivity  - Secondary Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context support\\\\n\\\\n                     - Network-initiated PDP context activation (PDP type IP only)\\\\n\\\\n                     - HSDPA support to 16 Mbps\\\\n\\\\n                     - 3GPP Gy Diameter credit control application interface\\\\n\\\\n                     - 3GPP R7 Gx+ policy interface\\\\n\\\\nIP address allocation  - Local pools\\\\n\\\\n                     - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\\\\n\\\\n                     - RADIUS\\\\n\\\\n                     - GTP support\\\\n\\\\n                     - GTP v0 and v1\\\\n\\\\n                     - GTP v0 to v1 fall back/fall forward conversion\\\\n\\\\n                     - GTP’ v1 and v2\\\\n\\\\nVPN and tunneling  - Multiple virtual router support\\\\n\\\\n                     - IPsec\\\\n\\\\n                     - L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and L2TP Network Server (LNS)\\\\n\\\\n                     - PPP regeneration: PDP type IP sessions into Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnel\\\\n\\\\n                     - IP-in-IP tunneling\\\\n\\\\n                     - Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunneling\\\\n\\\\n                     - 802.1q VLANs\\\\n\\\\nRouting  - Routing Information Protocol (RIP)\\\\n\\\\n                     - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)\\\\n\\\\n                     - Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP4)\\\\n\\\\nEnhanced applications  - Paging controller\\\\n\\\\n                     - Location register\\\\n\\\\n                     - Enhanced content charging\\\\n\\\\n                     - Content filtering/parental control\\\\n\\\\n                     - Stateful firewall\\\\n\\\\n                     - Peer-to-peer (P2P) detection and control\\\\n\\\\nFor More Information\\\\n\\\\n[For more information, visit www.cisco.com/go/mobileinternet.](https://www.cisco.com/go/mobileinternet)\\\\n\\\\n|Table 1.

Perfect for university dormitories or extended hospital stays,\\\\nCisco User Defined Network grants both device security and control, allowing each user to choose who can connect to their network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nFeature Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Wi-Fi 6** The IEEE 802.11ax emerging standard, also known as High-Efficiency Wireless (HEW) or Wi-Fi 6, builds on\\\\n**(802.11ax)** 802.11ac. It delivers a better experience in typical environments with more predictable performance for\\\\n\\\\nadvanced applications such as 4K or 8K video, high-density, high-definition collaboration apps, all-wireless\\\\noffices, and IoT. Wi-Fi 6 is designed to use both the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, unlike the 802.11ac standard.\\\\n\\\\n**Uplink/downlink** OFDMA-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into smaller frequency allocations called Resource Units\\\\n**OFDMA** (RUs), which can be assigned to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce\\\\n\\\\noverhead and latency.\\\\n\\\\n**Downlink** Supporting two spatial streams, MU-MIMO enables access points to split spatial streams between client\\\\n**MU‑MIMO** devices to maximize throughput.\\\\n**technology**\\\\n\\\\n**BSS coloring** Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allows the access points and their clients to\\\\ndifferentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.\\\\n\\\\n**Target Wake** A new power-saving mode called Target Wake Time (TWT) allows the client to stay asleep and to wake up\\\\n**Time** only at prescheduled (target) times to exchange data with the access point. This offers significant energy\\\\n\\\\nsavings for battery-operated devices, up to 3x to 4x the savings achieved by 802.11n and 802.11ac.\\\\n\\\\n**Intelligent** Intelligent Capture probes the network and provides Cisco DNA Center with deep analysis. The software can\\\\n**Capture** track more than 240 anomalies and instantaneously review all packets on demand, emulating the onsite\\\\n\\\\nnetwork administrator. Intelligent Capture allows for more informed decisions on your wireless networks.\\\\n\\\\n**Application** Application Hosting on Catalyst 9100 Access Points helps future-proof and simplify IoT deployments by\\\\n**Hosting on** eliminating the need to install and manage overlay networks. Utilizing the USB interface, containerized\\\\n**Catalyst 9100** applications and hardware modules can be deployed to reduce cost and complexity. Adding Cisco DNA\\\\n**Access** Center provides workflows and deployment-wide application lifecycle management.\\\\n\\\\n**Bluetooth 5** Integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 radio enables location-based use cases such as asset tracking, way\\\\nfinding or analytics.\\\\n\\\\n**Cisco** The 9105AX Series Wi-Fi 6 access points is available with a built-in controller. The Cisco Embedded Wireless\\\\n**Embedded** Controller on Catalyst 9100 Access Points provides an easy-to-deploy and manage option that does not\\\\n**Wireless** require a physical appliance. The control resides on the access point so there is no added footprint or\\\\n**Controller** complexity. And, because it uses Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series code, it’s easy to migrate your network as your\\\\n\\\\n[needs grow.

They are confronting the cost and complexity of supporting multiple platforms for 2.5G and 3G Serving GPRS Support Nodes\\\\n(SGSNs), Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSNs), and in the future the S4 SGSN. And many current SGSNs are optimized for General Packet Radio\\\\nService (GPRS) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) but unable to support migration to High Speed Packet Access (HSPA),\\\\nHSPA+, and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.\\\\n\\\\nCisco\\'s SGSN has become the choice for many of the world\\'s most innovative 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network operators\\\\ndeploying GSM, UMTS, and HSPA networks. The SGSN offers full support for UTRAN/GERAN to 3GPP core network access, in order to perform\\\\nmobility management, GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) tunneling and detunneling, Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context activation and management,\\\\nattaches and detaches, and billing.\\\\n\\\\nSupported on the Cisco [®] ASR 5000, the SGSN provides comprehensive, high-capacity, and standards-compliant GSM/GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, and\\\\nHSPA network access support. By performing IP-based transport on all radio and core network interfaces using standard interfaces, the SGSN\\'s\\\\nperformance and scalability is enhanced, while interconnectivity complexity is reduced, providing operators with higher performance for less\\\\noperational expenditure.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, the SGSN supports migration toward HSPA networks, and can be upgraded to a Release 8 SGSN that will allow interoperability with the\\\\nMobility Management Entity (MME) and the Serving Gateway (SGW) in EPC networks.\\\\n\\\\n#### The SGSN Difference\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco ASR 5000 is purpose built to address the needs of mobile packet core networks. Beginning with activation, the Cisco ASR 5000 SGSN\\\\nidentifies and authenticates the subscriber and routes the subscriber\\'s session to the GGSN within the core network. It can then be routed to any\\\\nendpoint, such as the Internet or any operator service. The SGSN also manages subscriber mobility and maintains subscriber information, enabling\\\\na consistent experience as a subscriber roams. Cisco\\'s SGSN accommodates a high rate of simultaneous attaches and detaches, making it the\\\\nideal solution for networks with high packet traffic and a significant subscriber base. In order to optimize the entire signaling chain, the SGSN\\'s\\\\ndesign eliminates or minimizes bottlenecks caused by large-scale control signaling.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Features and Benefits**\\\\n\\\\n#### • Industry-leading performance includes high capacity, exceptional throughput, and session and mobility management.\\\\n • Full UTRAN/GERAN to core network access support includes mobility management, GTP tunneling and de-tunneling, and\\\\n PDP context activation and management, as well as attaches/detaches and billing.\\\\n\\\\n • Optional support for Direct Tunnel and Cisco\\'s FastPath architecture helps improve the subscriber experience and reduce\\\\n operational and capital expenditures by optimizing the usage of subscriber plane resources.\\\\n\\\\n • 2.5G and 3G SGSNs may be combined on a single platform for greater flexibility.\\\\n • The SGSN can be combined with GGSN or EPC elements such as MME and SGW on a single platform to maximize efficiency\\\\n and flexibility, reduce latency, and simplify and optimize network architecture.\\\\n\\\\n • Frame Relay, ATM, and IP-based transport on all radio and core network interfaces enhances performance, offers\\\\n outstanding scalability, and reduces interconnectivity complexity.\\\\n\\\\n Network Flexibility and Efficiency\\\\n\\\\nNetwork efficiency and operational simplicity can be increased by combining the SGSN with Cisco\\'s GGSN on the same Cisco ASR 5000 platform.\\\\nThe platform is capable of handling the SGSN\\'s state-heavy characteristics and the GGSN\\'s processing-intensive characteristics within a single\\\\nsystem through the optimal use of common hardware, memory, and CPU resources.\\\\n\\\\nThe SGSN\\'s capability to support 2.5G and 3G services in the same chassis results in operational efficiencies as well as cost savings. Because the\\\\nSGSN handles 2.5G and 3G procedures in the same processes, fewer IP addresses are required, as both services appear as a single SGSN\\\\nservice and use common uplinks. In addition, there are no internal software interfaces between processes during 2.5G/3G handoffs. In this way, the\\\\nSGSN avoids repeated exchanges with the Home Location Registry (HLR) to retrieve the same subscriber state.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### Figure 1. Cisco\\'s Complementary SGSN and GGSN\\\\n\\\\nWith a simple software download, the SGSN can be upgraded to, or integrated with, SGSN Release 8 or even other EPC elements such as a Mobility\\\\nManagement Entity. This flexibility is of particular value to mobile operators who may be operating a blended network for years to come.\\\\n\\\\n#### Direct Tunnel and FastPath Support\\\\n\\\\nThe SGSN makes use of the Direct Tunnel architecture, which enables the SGSN to establish a direct subscriber plane tunnel between the radio\\\\naccess network (RAN) and the GGSN. In addition, the Cisco ASR 5000 also supports FastPath, which frees up the SGSN to perform other high-touch\\\\nservices and signaling procedures. With FastPath, no change is required to your architecture because the SGSN discerns no difference between\\\\nhome and roaming users, eliminating the need to perform new procedures.\\\\n\\\\n#### Location Management\\\\n\\\\nThe SGSN supports outstanding scalability of standards-based routing area updates (RAUs) for location management, including periodic RAUs,\\\\nintra-SGSN RAUs, and inter-SGSN RAUs. Further, the SGSN\\'s high capacity and flexible functionality provide a great opportunity to convert highimpact inter-SGSN RAUs to lower-impact intra-SGSN RAUs.\\\\n\\\\n#### Session Management\\\\n\\\\nCisco\\'s SGSN performs comprehensive session management, including context activation, modification, deactivation, and preservation. It also\\\\nprovides support for IPv4, IPv6, and PPP PDP context types. In addition, the SGSN\\'s intelligent PDP context preservation feature facilitates efficient\\\\nradio resource utilization.\\\\n\\\\n#### Charging\\\\n\\\\nThe SGSN supplies standards-based SGSN call detail records (S-CDRs) and mobility call detail records (M-CDRs). Further, the SGSN implements\\\\nthe standardized Ga interface for the exchange of charging data with one or more configured Charging Gateway Functions (CGFs).\\\\n\\\\n#### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco SGSN provides comprehensive, high-capacity, and standards-compliant GSM/GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, and HSPA network access. With the\\\\nSGSN, you can minimize capital and operational costs, ease deployment of revenue-generating services, and improve the reliability of your network to\\\\nboost your competitive edge.\\\\n\\\\n#### Table 1.

(1.36 kg)\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9120 Series is approximately 13% lighter and has 25% lower volume than the AP-2800 Series, yet is easy to deploy using the\\\\nsame Cisco Aironet[™] AIR-BRACKET-1 and AIR-BRACKET-2 mounting hardware.\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 mounting options\\\\n\\\\nThere are many different installation options available depending upon the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from\\\\nCisco as well as third-party companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each\\\\nbracket is a zero-dollar ($0) option at the time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the selection default is AIR-APBRACKET-1, which is the most popular for ceiling installations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-APBRACKET-2.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nTwo different types of mounting brackets\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 mounts flush and has the lowest profile. However, if\\\\nthe AP will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, or inside a National Electrical Manufactuers Association (NEMA) enclosure\\\\nor perhaps wall mounted, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in the bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes\\\\nline up with many popular electrical boxes. When mounting the bracket to the ceiling gridwork, some ceiling tiles are recessed. For this\\\\nreason, two different styles of ceiling clips, recessed and flush rails, are available see below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nDifferent clips are available for attaching to ceiling grid work\\\\n\\\\nChannel rail adapters - Cisco part number AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting APs to ceiling channel rails such as the ones shown in Figure 10, an optional channel adapter is used: AIR-CHNLADAPTER. It comes in a two-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip above. Refer to Figures 11 and 12.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall mounting the AP\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be a physical obstacle to the wireless signal; therefore,\\\\nmaintaining 360-degree coverage may be compromised by the wall. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a\\\\n180-degree pattern instead, a directional antenna often referred to as a “patch” antenna may be a better choice assuming the external\\\\nantenna model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall mounting APs with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party companies), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex mounting solutions for 9115, 9117, and 9120 Series access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following third-party companies are recommended for different types of mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberoninc.com/](http://www.oberoninc.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.ventev.com/](http://www.ventev.com/)\\\\n\\\\nIf wall mounted in a non-ceiling orientation the signal may penetrate the floor above and below, causing unintended coverage that could\\\\nresult in additional, needless roaming access when a mobility client (for example, a user with a Wi-Fi phone walks by on an adjacent floor).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.**\\\\n\\\\nCaveats when wall mounting the 9120 Series.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the color of an AP\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a desire to change the color of an AP, rather than painting the AP, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl\\\\ntape or using a colored plastic cover from Oberon.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon third-party option for changing the AP color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nAnother third-party option is a vinyl “skin” such as this one from AccelTex\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i and 9120e are rated for installation in the Plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the AP so that\\\\nnothing can be visible on the ceiling. In some cases, this is preferred for aesthetic reasons, so customers may install the AP above a drop\\\\nceiling. This also may be preferred in high-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing can be visible on\\\\nthe ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hangar accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used\\\\n(Figure 18). The Erico Caddy 512a, the Cooper B-Line BA50a, or similar T-bar Grid can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[www.erico.com/](http://www.erico.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.cooperindustries.com/](http://www.cooperindustries.com/)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of how to hang an AP above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.**\\\\n\\\\nInstalling the AP above ceiling tiles: pick an area clear of obstructions, avoid ceiling clutter\\\\n\\\\n## Areas with high vibration\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is installed using a “side arm”–type mount or other mounting locations where there is a likelihood of high vibration, it is\\\\nrecommended that a padlock or metal pin be used to prevent the AP from vibrating loose from the bracket.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.**\\\\n\\\\nA metal pin or padlock will not deteriorate over time so it is better than a plastic tie\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 and Power over Ethernet (PoE)\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Flexible power options even with limited 802.3af power\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** PoE draw: 9120 Series\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 series Power Power 2.4 GHz 5 GHz Link USB PD Power\\\\nSource Type Radio Radio Speed Draw\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXE / C9120AXP** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 1x1 1x1 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 2x2 N 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE N 2x2 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Ethernet cable recommendation is CAT-6 with a maximum distance of 328 feet (100 meters). Power required at the Power Source\\\\nEquipment (PSE) will be higher depending on the cable length and other environmental issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco has a line of multigigabit products that can easily power these access points\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Improving RF spectrum and performance of the access point client-serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nNext-generation Wi-Fi 6 access points starting with the Catalyst 9120 Series now contain a new radio based on a custom-designed Cisco\\\\nsilicon referred to as an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). This analytics radio enhances the performance of the access point’s\\\\nclient serving radios, as all this deep RF analysis is done on the RF ASIC.\\\\n\\\\nThe function of the Cisco RF ASIC (actually two ASIC chips) one is to analyze a frequency or range of frequencies of interest converting\\\\nthe received RF signal into Quadrature Signals known as I/Q data. This I/Q data is then passed onto a second ASIC that is a dedicated\\\\nbaseband processor for a deep RF analysis such as determining granular changes in the phase and amplitude as well as the modulation\\\\ncharacteristics of the inspected signal.\\\\n\\\\nThe I/Q data is evaluated by the Spectrum Analysis Engine (SAgE), which is custom designed to identify sources of non-Wi-Fi interference,\\\\nat the highest resolution, in the most simple and effective way.\\\\n\\\\nThink of the RF ASIC as a unique piece of hardware that not only contains CleanAir and SAgE, but is also much more advanced and has\\\\nthe capability to support advanced features in the future with software upgrades.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial capabilities of the RF ASIC include all the features of CleanAir/SAgE as well as the ability to sense DFS (Dynamic Frequency\\\\nSelection) events to augment the serving radio’s analysis of DFS for the very best DFS detection in the industry. This greatly improves\\\\nspectrum analysis and provides an always-on “second opinion” of the radio spectrum. This is referred to as dual DFS. In addition, the RF\\\\nASIC also plays a key role in Cisco’s RRM (Radio Resource Management) by providing off-channel analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120i with the Cisco RF ASIC chip\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120i antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\nThe 9120i has one of the most advanced antenna systems available on an access point.\\\\n\\\\nThe main serving radios default in this configuration:\\\\n\\\\n - Dedicated 5-GHz radio tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- (eXclusive OR) known as XOR radio is (defaulted to 2.4 GHz) tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 3 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Dual 5-GHz mode – XOR 2.4 GHz disabled secondary 5-GHz radio tied to dedicated 5-GHz antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the serving radio antennas, there are two other antennas:\\\\n\\\\n - BLE antenna with a gain of 2.1 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - RF ASIC antenna with a gain @ 2.4 GHz of 3 dBi and @ 5 GHz of 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC antenna is connected to a dedicated software-defined radio for spectrum analysis and other advanced RF features. The RF\\\\nASIC antenna is of the same design as the serving radio antennas to provide a similar view of the network as the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 2.4-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 5-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i secondary 5-GHz single-band antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i RF ASIC antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Fi** **24**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system using the DART connector for dual 5 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 27.**\\\\n\\\\nMount antennas away from each other whenever possible\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 4.** List of approved antennas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** These are all dual-band, dual-resonant antennas. Do not use single-band antennas on this product unless you choose to separate\\\\nthe AP into dedicated antennas (for example, dual 5 GHz or 5 GHz on top and 2.4 GHz on the DART). Single-band antennas need to be of\\\\nthe same gain and type as the antennas listed above and may not exceed 6 dBi on the 9120e Series.\\\\n\\\\n[For additional information on Cisco antennas, see the Cisco Antenna Reference Guide at this URL: https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref.](https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 contains a Flexible Radio Architecture (FRA). In a sense, the AP is a tri-band radio as it contains a dedicated 5-GHz\\\\nradio to serve clients and another flexible radio (known as an XOR radio) that can be assigned different functions within the network. The\\\\nflexible radio is similar to the previous XOR radio used in the Cisco Aironet AP-2800 and 3800 Series and is able to be configured to serve\\\\nclients in either 2.4 or 5 GHz or serially scan both 2.4 and 5 GHz on the flexible radio while the main 5-GHz radio serves clients.\\\\n\\\\n## FRA and dual 5-GHz operations\\\\n\\\\nManaging dual 5-GHz cells is one of the most important things that FRA does. There are two modes of operation for dual 5-GHz APs:\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Micro – A large cell with a smaller cell internal, creating double the capacity within the boundaries of a single cell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Macro – Dual independent 5-GHz cells, doubling the coverage of a single traditional dual-band AP. Macro/Macro is only\\\\n\\\\nsupported on 9120e (as external antennas are used to accomplish this).\\\\n\\\\nMacro/Micro is a use case applicable to the Catalyst 9120i models, as the internal antennas are designed to support a cell-within-a-cell\\\\ndeployment. In order for this to be effective, much design is committed to isolation of the two cells, starting at the silicon and ending with\\\\nseparation in antenna polarity and frequency separation.\\\\n\\\\nFRA and Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) will enforce many configuration requirements when operating as dual 5-GHz Macro/Micro:\\\\n\\\\n - Minimum 100-MHz channel separation (frequency diversity)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Micro cell power is restricted to minimum\\\\n\\\\n - Same Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) on each cell\\\\n\\\\nHaving a Macro/Micro cell architecture is attractive because it solves the problem of having one large cell, in which a very diverse client\\\\nexperience exists. Clients closer to the AP are using higher data rates and enjoy a higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) than will clients at the\\\\nedge of the cell. Macro/Micro allows isolation of different clients within the cell that can serve them best and preserves airtime by increasing\\\\noverall efficiency.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\nPicture of a Macro and Micro cell\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA dual 5 GHz capable Catalyst 9120i creating Micro/Macro cells can perform much like two independent 5 GHz access points would using\\\\nall the features and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Catalyst 9120i is operating in dual 5-GHz mode, clients get equal airtime, lower channel utilization rates, faster client-connected\\\\ndata rates, and less retries.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\nSingle 5-GHz channel and dual 5-GHz channel\\\\n\\\\nIn the figure above, (on the left) a single channel cell, say channel 36, has a channel utilization of 60% because all clients are connected to\\\\nthat one channel. To make matters worse, they connect at nonuniform speeds, as the close-in clients connect much faster than the faraway clients.\\\\n\\\\n(Left) Single-channel model – utilization is at 60% on channel 36\\\\n\\\\n(Right) Dual-channel model – channel 36 drops to 20% and channel 108 is at 24%\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the dual-channel model (on the right), by using two channels, the improvements become clear. This results in far less contention\\\\nand less retries and a far better user experience. Note: This feature was first introduced in the 2800/3800 Series, which won Cisco’s\\\\nPioneer Award for innovation in engineering design in 2017. This mode has a very big advantage for reducing channel utilization when\\\\ncombined with Wi-Fi 6 features that help with latency and small packets.\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: Using dual 5GHz, users experience faster throughput, less retries, and a better Wi-Fi experience due to faster data rates and**\\\\nless channel utilization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco CleanAir technology: a custom hardware/software solution.\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome the visibility limitations inherent to standard Wi-Fi chipsets, Cisco has created an integrated solution with patented chips and\\\\nsoftware that has been specifically designed to analyze and classify all RF activity. (More than 25 patents have been issued for this\\\\ntechnology to date.)\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, Cisco has taken the technology behind the Cisco Spectrum Expert analysis tool and integrated it directly into the infrastructure,\\\\nincluding deep integration with a dedicated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and a custom RF ASIC. This is a significant development and\\\\nclearly demonstrates that wireless has transitioned from nice-to-have to business-critical in the enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThe custom solution starts with the Cisco SAgE hardware core, which has been integrated directly into the Cisco RF ASIC custom silicon.\\\\nThe SAgE core handles very compute-intensive operations, such as high-resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pulse detection\\\\noperations. (A pulse is a burst of RF energy in frequency and time.) The SAgE core has a highly granular spectral resolution of 78.125 kHz\\\\n(4x better than the nearest competitive solution and 64x better than most chipsets).\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC provides the AP with an advanced and comprehensive interference analysis, detection, and mitigation system. Essentially,\\\\nthe SAgE core handles a base level of spectrum analysis operations that are so processing intensive that they can be prohibitive to handle\\\\nin real-time software or by the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Comprehensive RF analysis and insight into the spectrum that no other competitor has, clearly identifying interference on a\\\\ndedicated software-defined radio (separate from the client serving radios) so as to not impact access point client-serving performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir clearly identifies the interference using dedicated radio and custom silicon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC and CleanAir chipset augments in the determination of DFS signals enhancing and reducing DFS false alerts so the AP can\\\\nstay on a DFS channel more robustly. In addition to this, the dedicated radio participates in Cisco’s RRM for interference mitigation and\\\\nbest channel selection.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nDFS event (detected by Wi-Fi chipset) is compared to RF ASIC to verify it is indeed a real DFS event\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC is far more advanced than the DFS detection used by the Wi-Fi chipset and serves as a “second set of eyes” into the\\\\nspectrum. The RF ASIC as a dedicated SDR will be enhanced further with new features as future software upgrades are released.\\\\n\\\\n## FastLocate - RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco CMX FastLocate technology enables quick location refresh for connected Wi-Fi clients. Readability Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\\\\nfrom data packets and probe frames, when available, are used for calculating a location. This technology is available with both centrally\\\\nswitched WLANs and Cisco FlexConnect[®] (locally switched WLANs).\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: The Catalyst 9120, with its onboard RF ASIC monitoring radio, enhances location by allowing access points on different clientserving channels to use the RF ASIC to listen to the probes and data packets on the Wi-Fi client of interest regardless of its channel.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nRF ASIC radio can track Wi-Fi clients regardless of the serving channel\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing, warehouses, and factories\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of the material being warehoused. When\\\\nperforming a coverage check (site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels as the material being warehoused can change\\\\nthe RF coverage, creating loss of uniform coverage. Also, try to position the APs as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the\\\\nantennas when possible or practical to do so. If the AP is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, “best case.” When\\\\nconfiguring coverage for aisles, try to use directional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain\\\\nomnidirectional antennas on the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units with integrated antennas as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to\\\\nhave more nulls.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the AP lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example shown in the picture\\\\nbelow.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nAP Placement in warehouse environment\\\\n\\\\n(External dipole “e” series or internal antenna “i” series version could be used)\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting an AP at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to\\\\nthe holes of most electrical boxes. Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 34.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting an AP onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare/clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nIf the Catalyst 9120 is used in a clean room, hospital, or other areas where the need for infection control requires the access point to be\\\\nwiped down with a chemical, it is recommended that a ready-to-use sterilant such as Steris “Spor-Klenz” be used. Unlike some access\\\\npoints, the Catalyst 9120 does not have vent holes in the construction, so it may be wiped down. The plastics have been tested with this\\\\nmaterial.\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant](http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant)\\\\n\\\\nIf the healthcare environment requires metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 35.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStadiums and harsh environments\\\\n\\\\nCustomers wishing to install the AP in harsh environments where it may be exposed to weather, such as sporting areas, stadiums, open\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA enclosure. This varies around the world. For example,\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit AP outdoor NEMA enclosures if the AP is indoors, such as in a freezer or garden area, but may prohibit its\\\\nuse outdoors. This seems to vary with weather radar compliance in different countries and often UNII-1 compliance. Check with your Cisco\\\\naccount team or the communications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 36.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of an AccelTex 12x10x6 NEMA enclosure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberonwireless.com/](http://www.oberonwireless.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.terra-wave.com/](http://www.terra-wave.com/)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-type enclosure, try to have the cables exit out of the bottom of the enclosure so that rain and moisture do not run\\\\ndown the cable into the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating. For example, a black enclosure gets much\\\\nhotter in the sun than a white one. You may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nEducation/schools\\\\n\\\\nSee the deployment guide at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/sch\\\\noolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing APs near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route wiring electrical or Ethernet in the near field (6 to 15 inches) from the antenna. Try\\\\nto refrain from installing the AP in the electrical closet, as the best place for the AP is as close to the users as possible or practical. If you\\\\nmust remote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire/safety regulations for more\\\\non this).\\\\n\\\\nBelow are a few URLs for understanding interference:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Sol\\\\nutions_White_Paper.html\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing APs in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is\\\\nimportant to check the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is\\\\nonly a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of APs rather\\\\nquickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna (or the\\\\nactual AP) on the bottom of the elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing any Wi-Fi equipment inside the elevator cars or shafts, local regulations need to be followed, as many times such\\\\ninstallations are prohibited either for safety reasons or because the building owner or local fire department may prohibit them. Also, it is\\\\ndangerous, and only elevator repair persons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas. When the need for\\\\nexternal antennas is a requirement, again position/use the Catalyst 9120e model.\\\\n\\\\n## WLAN best practices: Catalyst 9120\\\\n\\\\nAccess point antenna placement\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i access point has an advanced antenna system but correct placement of the AP is critical.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 37.**\\\\n\\\\nCoverage is optimized for ceiling placement and radiates omnidirectionally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a Wi Fi device such as an AP and you are going to use another AP in the vicinity on a different channel, it is recommended that\\\\nyou space each AP apart by approximately 6 feet (2 meters). Avoid clustering the APs or the antennas from different APs together, as this\\\\ncould cause degradation in performance. This recommended distance is based on the assumption that both devices operate in the\\\\nunlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB - that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges, for example, frequency-hopping\\\\nlegacy APs or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the AP (think below or above the 2.4 and 5-GHz band), you should\\\\nconsider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference by\\\\ntesting both devices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much, if\\\\nany, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\nWarning\\\\n\\\\nIn order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located at a minimum of 7.9 inches\\\\n(20 centimeters) or more from the body of all persons. See the installation guide under declaration of conformity for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nMixing access points of different models and types\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 is a very advanced access point supporting Wi-Fi 6 features along with unique features such as dual 5 GHz and\\\\nadvanced RF detection using Cisco custom RF ASIC silicon.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, it is not recommended that you mix access point models, sometimes called “salt and pepper,” as it would diminish the\\\\nperformance of the Cisco DNA network, degrading many of our advanced features and perhaps introducing a suboptimal performance.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, if you have a mixture of AP types, it is recommended that you group like access points together (for example, AP-3800s\\\\non, say, one floor and Cisco Catalyst 9120s on another) and refrain from mixing them.\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 general placement guidelines\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding access point installations.\\\\n\\\\n1. Always try to mount the AP as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment (for example, hospitals\\\\n\\\\nhave metal doors, coverage can change when the doors close, old buildings can have metal grid work in the plaster or asbestos). Avoid\\\\nmounting the AP or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area affecting clients.\\\\n\\\\n2. When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1-, 6-, and 11-channel scheme is used as is the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting all\\\\n\\\\nof the APs on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can.\\\\n\\\\n3. Cisco RRM, FRA, and other features can help automate the process.\\\\n\\\\n4. Try to determine which clients are heavily used, checking the coverage with those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might not\\\\n\\\\nhave the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip\\\\n\\\\nVerify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n5. While site surveys are highly recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco RRM is in place, sometimes a limited site\\\\n\\\\nsurvey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. If this is a very challenging environment, such as train connectivity, gas and oil\\\\nverticals, or large hospitals, Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform your\\\\ninstallation. See your Cisco account team for more information.\\\\n\\\\nExample of a channel coverage model spacing nonoverlapping channels\\\\n\\\\nAntenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical or possible, please keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low Loss (LL) and ultralow loss (ULL)\\\\ncables, which have the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nCisco cables carry the part number AIR-CAB (Aironet Cable) and then a length. For example, a 20-ft length of LL cable with RP-TNC\\\\nconnector is Cisco AIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing\\\\nareas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 38.**\\\\n\\\\nWhen drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically 5/8 inch) drill bit\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6 installations and site survey considerations\\\\n\\\\nWh t d h i t ll d t d ? N i th ti t l t WLAN d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nrequirements.\\\\n\\\\n- 1:1 replacement assumes the AP was installed in the best place to meet your current coverage and density goals.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Do you have any coverage issues today that you have not addressed?\\\\n\\\\n- Are there any poorly mounted or suboptimal installations?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Ideally you should have at least 802.3at (30W PoE) available.\\\\n\\\\n - Wi-Fi 6 might help mitigate a poor design, but nothing beats installing it right the first time.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many tools out there to model and perform site surveys. Cisco has recently worked with Ekahau to import Cisco APs and\\\\nantenna models into their application, which also includes the ability to model BLE as well. The Catalyst 9120 AP model will be in the next\\\\nmaintenance release (current is 10.0.1).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 39.**\\\\n\\\\nEkahau offers a site survey and WLAN planner software\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing an active survey for placement, it is always best to have the equipment you plan to deploy. Having the actual model that is\\\\nbeing planned for is not always possible at the time that planning is being done. Cisco spends a great deal of effort to ensure that newermodel AP’s RF coverage matches closely with previous models of APs to reduce the cost of planning and replacing APs. The C9120 is no\\\\ndifferent. The below graphic shows the C9120 as compared with the AP3802i on the same channel and power, as an example only.\\\\nSurveying using an alternate AP is suitable for Bill of Material (BOM) generation or updates to an existing installation. Critical coverage\\\\nshould always be measured using the same model to be certain of the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 40.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of C9120 and AP3802i coverage patterns as measured over the air\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 41.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex site survey battery pack P/N ATS-SSBP-1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nUseful URLs within the guide:\\\\n\\\\n1.

With the Cisco Catalyst Wi-Fi 6E access points, you\\\\ndon’t need to make the decision now. Keep the operational mode you use today, whether on premises or cloud management. If\\\\nyour needs change—either way—it’s an easy switch. No new hardware required. That’s investment protection for your network\\\\nthat you can count on.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9162I, 9164I, 9166I and 9166D1 all use common hardware for on-prem and cloud operation.\\\\n\\\\n## Cisco Catalyst CW9166D1 overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst CW9166D1 is very similar to the Cisco CW9166I – internal hardware features and functionality are essentially\\\\nthe same as the Catalyst CW9166I with a few features added that we will discuss later in this paper. The take-way is that the\\\\nCW9166I has an omni-directional antenna and the CW9166D1 has an integrated directional antenna array.\\\\n\\\\nThis internal directional antenna differs slightly from previous directional AP products that used external (removeable) antennas.\\\\nThis is due mostly to regulatory constraints placed upon products operating using 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) especially when the product\\\\ncovers the entire 6 GHz spectrum, and when the desire is to focus the AP’s energy into a given direction.\\\\n\\\\nLow Power Access Points such as the Catalyst CW9166D1 can operate in the entire spectrum of 6 GHz, and as such must comply\\\\nwith regulatory agency rules in different countries (theaters) that often specify that products covering a large spectrum in 6 GHz\\\\nmust be for indoor use only with an integrated antenna and cannot have any external attached antenna or have weather-resistant\\\\nenclosures.\\\\n\\\\nProducts with a limited spectrum coverage may support external antennas and be used outdoors but due to the limited spectrum\\\\ncoverage mostly UNII-5 and UNII-7 – it makes sense to integrate the directional antenna into the CW9166D1 allowing it the most\\\\nflexibility and spectrum coverage for indoor use.\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 is a Cisco Wi-Fi 6E access point platform, with a penta-radio architecture providing the full capability of 802.11ax,\\\\nsuch as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO), Target\\\\nWake Time (TWT), BSS Coloring, overlapping BSS packet detection (OBSS-PD), and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3), all while\\\\nbeing able to leverage advanced RF visibility with Cisco CleanAir[®] Pro together with an artificial intelligence and machine learning\\\\n(AI/ML)-driven scanning radio.\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 when operated in with the Cisco Catalyst Wireless LAN controller supports the entire Cisco Catalyst\\\\nwireless stack functionality with Cisco Catalyst Center (Automation and Assurance), Cisco Spaces (formerly Cisco Catalyst\\\\nSpaces) (location and IoT), Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) (security), and more.\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 is an indoor Wi-Fi 6E AP that operates in Low Power mode using capabilities listed in the table below.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Cisco Catalyst CW9166D1 capabilities\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**AI/ML-driven scanning**\\\\n**radio**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst CW9166D1 is similar in hardware to the 9166I except it has an integrated directional antenna and is slightly wider and is\\\\navailable with an optional articulating mount.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst CW9166D1 AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is used often in conjunction with an optional articulating mount allowing the AP to be\\\\nplaced at ceiling height or higher and then angled downward to cover a particular area.\\\\n\\\\n## Use cases for CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 4.**\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 is an ideal product for auditoriums and other places where focused connectivity is desired.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 is an ideal product for auditoriums and other places where focused connectivity is desired in a warehouse\\\\nenvironment.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 can be wall mounted instead of traditional ceiling mounted Access Points when the desire is to cover long hallways.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 can be used in areas with really high ceilings as the directional antenna can focus downward into a given area.\\\\n\\\\nIt is recommended when mounting Access Points to locate them as close to the users as possible, in the case of extremely high\\\\nceilings, Access Points with directional antenna arrays such as the CW9166D1 can improve the range of the client allowing the\\\\nantenna to be mounted typically higher than the recommended distance of 10-15 Feet. Always be sure to test the connectivity\\\\nduring the installation process when the ceiling height exceeds 18 Ft.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, when co-locating units especially in close proximity, it is a good practice to test both units operating concurrently at heavy\\\\nload (and then test each unit individually at heavy load) to verify the units are not interfering with each other. Whenever a unit is\\\\nin close proximity of another unit (always try to space the operating channels <frequencies> as far apart as practical) verify any\\\\ndegradation that may occur is acceptable if not try reducing RF power or relocating the units. Anytime a unit is in very close\\\\nproximity to another unit the potential of RF degradation (desense) can occur.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nCW9166D1 can be co-located but care must be taken to separate the frequencies and fully test to determine if there is any\\\\ndegradation.\\\\n\\\\n## Supported software matrix\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** Supported Cisco IOS XE Software for the CW9166D1.\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9800 controller software release\\\\n\\\\nCisco IOS XE 17.12.1 and later for Catalyst CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n## Supported wireless controller platforms\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9162I, CW9164I, CW9166I and CW9166D1 are supported in the following wireless controller platforms:\\\\n\\\\n   - Catalyst 9800-L\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Catalyst 9800-40\\\\n\\\\n- Catalyst 9800-80\\\\n\\\\n- Catalyst 9800-CL (virtual controller for both private and public cloud)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** Cisco Catalyst CW9166D1 capability matrix\\\\n\\\\nFeature CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n**Scale** 1200 clients total\\\\n(400 clients per radio)\\\\n\\\\n**Client-serving radios** 4x4 2.4 GHz 11ax, 4x4 5 GHz 11ax, 4x4 6 GHz 11ax\\\\n(or)\\\\n4x4 2.4 GHz 11ax, (dual 5 GHz) 4x4 5 GHz 11ax, 4x4 5 GHz 11ax\\\\n\\\\n**Features** Download and upload OFDMA and MU-MIMO, BSS Coloring, TWT\\\\n\\\\n**LAN port** PoE-IN Multigigabit 5 Gbps\\\\n\\\\n**Ports** mGig0, console\\\\n\\\\n**Antenna** Integrated - Directional\\\\n\\\\n**Dimensions (W x L x H)** 9.5 x 9.5 x 2.3 in.\\\\n(241.3 x 241.3 x 58.4 mm)\\\\n\\\\n**Weight** 3.5 lb.

It is designed with two\\\\nridges on the top, allowing you to identify them among the other APs instantly. Not only is the design aesthetically pleasing and\\\\nvery functional. A larger recessed cable access area is provided for better access to cabling and faster, easier deployment.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nFront and back view of Catalyst CW9166D1 – Uses standard Cisco metal bracket and has a larger recessed area for cabling.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** AIR-AP-Bracket-2 is the default and preferred bracket for the CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\nThis enlarged recessed area allows cables to be inserted into the ports without bending, for an improved cabling experience. This\\\\nis depicted in the figure below, when compared with a Catalyst 9130 Series AP.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of cabling experience of Catalyst CW9166D1 vs. Catalyst 9130AXI on the right\\\\n\\\\n## Physical dimensions\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 has an incredible ratio of dimensions/weight to performance. They are similar in size and weight to the\\\\nmidrange and high-end Catalyst Wi-Fi 6 APs and smaller and lighter than many of the Cisco Aironet APs. However, they boast a\\\\nmuch more robust penta-radio architecture and support the entirety of Wi-Fi 6E.\\\\n\\\\nRefer to the figures below for the dimensions and weight.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.**\\\\n\\\\nDimensions and weight of the Catalyst CW9164I, CW9166I and CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe following figure depicts the ports and reset button on the Catalyst CW9166D1.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nPhysical ports and buttons of the Catalyst CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n**Ethernet port**\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 comes with a 5-Gbps uplink port.\\\\n\\\\n**Console port**\\\\n\\\\nThe console port (RJ-45) is used to access the AP’s command-line interface (CLI).\\\\n\\\\n**DC input power**\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 has an optional DC input power of 54V to operate the AP at full capability.\\\\n\\\\n**Reset button**\\\\n\\\\nThe Reset button is used to reset the AP to the factory settings.\\\\n\\\\nFollow these steps to reset the AP.\\\\n\\\\n1. Connect the console cable.\\\\n\\\\n2. Unplug the PoE network cable from the switch.\\\\n\\\\n3. Press and hold the Reset button.\\\\n\\\\n4. Plug the power back into the AP.\\\\n\\\\n5. Wait until the output on the console says “Button pressed. Configuration Reset is Activated.” Hold the button for 20\\\\n\\\\nseconds for a full configuration reset and 30 seconds for a factory reset. Once the button is released, the AP will reboot\\\\nto the state listed above.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 has three built-in environmental sensors: air quality, humidity, and temperature. As shown in Figure 5,\\\\nthe openings on the right are where these sensors are located on the AP.\\\\n\\\\nMore details on these sensors are provided in the “Internet of Things Integration” section of the 9166I deployment guide at this\\\\nURL: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9164-series-access-points/catalyst-9166i-9164i-dg.html.\\\\n\\\\n## Cabling\\\\n\\\\nThe use of proper cable types will directly affect the performance of the Catalyst CW9166D1. Since this AP has a 5-Gbps port,\\\\nthe recommendation is to use either CAT6 or CAT6a cable, which support speeds of up to 10 Gbps. CAT5e cables can still be\\\\nused; however, there may be an effect on the AP’s performance.\\\\n\\\\nRefer to the table below to compare cable types that can be used with the Catalyst CW9166D1.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 6.** Cable types supported.\\\\n\\\\nCable type Speeds Maximum length\\\\n\\\\n**CAT5e** 5 Gbps 328 feet (100 meters)\\\\n\\\\n**CAT6** 1, 2.5, or 5 Gbps 330 feet (100 meters)\\\\n\\\\n10 Gbps 164 feet (50 meters)\\\\n\\\\n**CAT6a** 10 Gbps 330 feet (100 meters)\\\\n\\\\n## Brackets and mounting\\\\n\\\\nRegarding mounting, the Catalyst CW9166D1 uses AIR-AP-Bracket-2 as the default bracket. While AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 would fit\\\\nthe CW9166D1 that bracket is designed for ceiling mounting and therefore is better suited for the Catalyst CW9166I as it is\\\\ndesigned for ceiling installations whereas the CW9166D1 with its directional antenna array is primarily designed for wall mounting.\\\\n\\\\nFor more details on mounting the APs, refer to the following:\\\\n\\\\n   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/cw916x/cw9166d1/install-guide/b-hig-cw9166D1/overview.htm\\\\n\\\\nl\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - [Access Point Mounting Instructions](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/mounting/guide/apmount.html)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting options for Catalyst CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\nThe following figures provide details about the AIR-AP-Bracket-2 for reference.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-AP-BRACKET-2\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-AP-BRACKET-2 schematics\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-AP-BRACKET-2 schematics continued\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.**\\\\n\\\\nDimensions for CW-MNT-ART2-00 Articulating mount (connects to AIR-AP-BRACKET-2)\\\\n\\\\n## Getting started with Wi Fi 6E\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6E takes the 802.11ax protocol to the next level by introducing a brand-new spectrum, 6 GHz. This new spectrum is much\\\\nwider than the legacy bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) and allows wireless devices to take advantage of the performance\\\\nenhancements introduced with Wi-Fi 6. The new spectrum is reserved for greenfield Wi-Fi 6 client operation only. This means\\\\nthat no previous generations of Wi-Fi will be permitted to operate there. This eliminates the performance-robbing requirements of\\\\nbackward compatibility often experienced in previous spectrums. In addition, the amount of spectrum provided encourages and\\\\nenables the use of wider 80- and 160-MHz channels, which dramatically increases the speed while simultaneously providing\\\\nenough room to operate without the co-channel interference issues experienced in the 2.4- and 5-GHz spectrums.\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6E migration and deployment tips\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6E (6 GHz) is a new spectrum standard, and with it comes several new requirements that were not present in the past. This\\\\nsection goes over key points about Wi-Fi 6E that play a part in the deployment of the CW9166D1 APs.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts a high-level representation of Cisco’s recommendations, tips, and tricks for deploying the Catalyst\\\\nCW9166D1 APs, while the sections that follow expand upon the details of each.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi deployment and migration recommendations, Note AP coverage 1500-2000 square ft. however, the CW9166D1 this\\\\ncoverage is not Omni-directional so while the amount of sq foot is essentially the same, the amount of footage is focused in a\\\\ndirectional 70-degree pattern at 2.4 and 5 GHz and 60-degree at 6 GHz. Additionally, SSIDs are limited to 8 SSIDs on 6 GHz\\\\nband.\\\\n\\\\nMigration to 6 GHz\\\\n\\\\nWhen deploying a new Wi-Fi 6E AP, there are two categories of considerations: whether you have a greenfield (no existing APs)\\\\nor a brownfield (have existing APs) deployment.\\\\n\\\\nBrownfield deployment: While we always recommend that you conduct site surveying and wireless coverage planning with tools\\\\nsuch as Ekahau or iBwave, the general rule of thumb for a brownfield deployment is to have a one-to-one AP replacement. The\\\\nreason is that you will likely still have to serve legacy band clients such as 2.4 or 5 GHz. If the legacy APs were strategically\\\\nplaced at the current location using an external 6 dBi directional antenna for the best legacy band coverage, the Catalyst 9166D1\\\\nwill likely provide the best coverage there.\\\\n\\\\nGreenfield deployment: If there are no existing APs, the suggestion is to use Ekahau or iBwave to conduct proper wireless\\\\nplanning before deploying any APs physically to ensure the best wireless coverage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 support three power types: 802.3bt (Cisco UPOE[®], equivalent to 60W), 802.3at (PoE+, equivalent to\\\\n30W), and 802.3af (PoE, equivalent to 15W) or through DC input power. The AP can be powered by any of these power types;\\\\nhowever, to get all the capabilities of the AP, an input power of 802.3bt must be used. Refer to the “Power Options” section above\\\\nfor a detailed overview of what input power type supports what radio, port, and USB settings.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to selecting a proper switching infrastructure to connect and power your wireless infrastructure, there are several\\\\nfactors to consider. To ensure that you have the most optimal switching infrastructure deployed, refer to the following Cisco\\\\n[UPOE+ white paper: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/nb-06-upoe-plus-it-ot-wp-cte-en.html.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/nb-06-upoe-plus-it-ot-wp-cte-en.html)\\\\n\\\\nMultigigabit Switching\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 has one 5-Gbps Multigigabit port, so to take advantage of its performance, your switches need to\\\\nsupport Multigigabit speeds.\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about Cisco Multigigabit switching technology, refer to the following webpage: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutio\\\\nns/enterprise-networks/catalyst-multigigabit-switching/index.html#~benefits.\\\\n\\\\n6-GHz spectrum considerations\\\\n\\\\nWith the introduction of Wi-Fi 6E, the spectrum has been significantly expanded compared with 5 GHz and especially 2.4 GHz.\\\\nSpanning from 5925 MHz to 7125 MHz, we now have 59x 20-MHz channels, 29x 40-MHz channels, 14x 80-MHz channels, and 7x\\\\n160-MHz channels.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\nThe 6-GHz spectrum\\\\n\\\\nCertain countries have yet to allow parts of or the entire 6-GHz spectrum. At the time this document was written, Europe/CEPT\\\\nhas approved only 5925 MHz to 6425 MHz, compared to the U.S., which has approved the whole spectrum.\\\\n\\\\nThe increase in spectrum width provides several advantages, with one of the most prominent being a lowered risk of co-channel\\\\ninterference. Since there are more channels to select from, it’s much less likely that APs in a similar physical location will be\\\\nbroadcasting RF on the same channels. In the past, this concern for co-channel interference is what prevented users from taking\\\\nadvantage of 80-MHz or 160-MHz bonded channel widths. Although throughput tests showed that they could provide great\\\\nperformance numbers, the problem was that deploying them in such a fashion was simply not practical in most production\\\\nenterprise settings, because fewer channels meant a greater chance of interference and reduced overall capacity. With the\\\\nintroduction of Wi-Fi 6E, 80 and 160 MHz can now be used, allowing us to take advantage of the increased speeds in a\\\\nproduction scenario.\\\\n\\\\nTo configure your access point’s 6-GHz radio as 80 or 160 MHz, navigate to the following in your Catalyst 9800 controller:\\\\nConfiguration > Wireless > Access Points > [Select a 6 GHz radio] > Configure > Channel Width > [select 80 MHz or 160 MHz] >\\\\n\\\\n[Click Update and Apply to Device].\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.**\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring a 6-GHz radio channel width – Note screen shots may be different depending upon version of software etc.\\\\n\\\\nThe instruction above demonstrates how to change the channel width manually as a reference. However, we recommend using\\\\nthe Catalyst 9800’s radio resource management (RRM) feature with dynamic channel and bandwidth selection to automatically\\\\ndetermine the channel and bandwidth the radios should be serving on for best performance. Refer to the “6-GHz Radio Resource\\\\nManagement” section below for more details.\\\\n\\\\nAnother benefit of the 6-GHz spectrum is that it is still clean and without much interference compared with legacy bands such as\\\\n2.4 GHz, which shared the spectrum with the likes of BLE, Zigbee, microwave, and various other RF devices. With 6 GHz, we can\\\\nexpect that most of the spectrum use will be by other Wi-Fi 6E wireless clients of similar speeds, resulting in not only a more\\\\nefficient spectrum but also a more secure one, thanks to the WPA3 mandate described in the “Security Requirements” section\\\\nbelow.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6E requires that all WLANs be configured with WPA3 and Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), together with Protected\\\\nManagement Frames (PMF) enabled in both the AP and the client. Because previous bands didn’t require WPA3, this\\\\nrequirement allows Wi-Fi 6E to be the most secure spectrum. From a deployment perspective, this will likely affect how you create\\\\nWLANs, since many legacy clients might not support WPA3 security. This is covered in the “WLAN Design Considerations”\\\\nsection.\\\\n\\\\nThe requirement to configure a Wi-Fi 6E WLAN with WPA3 security is not specific to Cisco but general to Wi-Fi 6E and applies to\\\\nall vendors.\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about WPA3, refer to the WPA3 Deployment Guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/cata\\\\nlyst-9100ax-access-points/wpa3-dep-guide-og.html.\\\\n\\\\nWireless coverage planning\\\\n\\\\n6 GHz is a new spectrum and therefore requires special planning and site surveying to determine the best areas for AP\\\\nplacement, especially in greenfield deployments. While 6 GHz provides faster speeds, its wavelengths are shorter, meaning that\\\\nits range is shorter as well compared to 5 and 2.4 GHz. This factor may result in the Catalyst CW9166D1 being placed in slightly\\\\ndifferent location than previous APs that broadcast only 2.4 and 5 GHz to ensure optimal RF coverage in a greenfield\\\\ndeployment.\\\\n\\\\nCisco recommends always conducting a site survey and using Ekahau or iBwave for wireless planning. These tools will allow you\\\\nto upload floor plans of your building and simulate the RF of a Catalyst 9166D1 to determine where the APs should be placed for\\\\nthe best coverage. Once you’ve determined the optimal locations for your Catalyst CW9166D1 you can deploy them physically.\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst Center AP refresh workflow\\\\n\\\\nWhen migrating to new APs in a brownfield deployment, the new APs often take the place of incumbent APs with a one-to-one\\\\nreplacement. Assuming that your wireless infrastructure is being managed by Cisco Catalyst Center, you would also need to\\\\nreplace both the APs managed by the inventory and those assigned to a floor map. To do this efficiently, Cisco Catalyst Center\\\\nhas an AP refresh workflow that allows you to easily replace old APs with new ones. This eliminates the tedious manual process of\\\\ndeleting old APs and streamlines the entire workflow.\\\\n\\\\nRefer to the Build and Deploy Workflows chapter of the Cisco Catalyst Center User Guide for reference on the AP refresh\\\\nworkflow: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation-and-management/dna-center/22-3/user_guide/b_cisco_dna_center_ug_2_2_3/m_dnac_workflows.html.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nAs stated in the Security Requirements section, for an SSID to be broadcast on 6 GHz you need:\\\\n\\\\n   - WPA3 or OWE as Layer 2 security.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - Protected Management Frames (PMF).\\\\n\\\\n   - No other Layer 2 security method is allowed – a mixed mode is not possible.\\\\n\\\\nOn one hand this is good, because it makes 6 GHz extremely secure, but it also means that you need to reconsider your\\\\nSSID/WLAN design, as multiple legacy clients you have in your network might not support these requirements, and most likely\\\\nyour current WLAN configuration would prevent them from being supported on 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nSo how would you design your SSID and define your security settings to adopt 6 GHz but at the same time guarantee backward\\\\ncompatibility for existing clients?\\\\n\\\\nThere are three options available:\\\\n\\\\n1. “ALL-IN” Option: Reconfigure the existing WLAN to WPA3, one SSID for all Radio Policies (2.4/5 and 6 GHz).\\\\n\\\\n2. “One SSID” Option: Configure One WLAN profile with WPA2+WPA3 Transition Mode as the Security.\\\\n\\\\n3. “Multiple SSIDs” Option: Re-design your SSIDs adding specific SSID/WLAN with specific security settings.\\\\n\\\\nThe recommended option for enterprise is to add a separate WPA3 SSID (Option 3), with a different SSID name, and broadcast it\\\\nin all bands. The WPA3-capable clients in the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands would be able to connect and enjoy the most\\\\nsecure wireless network possible. Since you are not touching your existing SSIDs, legacy clients not supporting WPA3 will\\\\ncontinue to connect to legacy SSIDs. The drawback of this option is that you need to broadcast an additional SSID, and you need\\\\nto manage an additional wireless profile on the new WPA3-capable clients.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n\\\\nA new SSID with WPA3 with dot1x only Security for employees and an SSID with WPA3 with SAE for guest.\\\\n\\\\nExisting SSIDs (2.4/5 GHz):\\\\n\\\\nCorporate SSID: employee Security: WPA2 with dot1x\\\\n\\\\nGuest SSID: guest Security: WPA2 with PSK\\\\n\\\\nNew SSIDs (2.4/5/6 GHz):\\\\n\\\\nCorporate SSID: employee_wpa3 Security: WPA3 with dot1x\\\\n\\\\nGuest SSID: guest_wpa3 Security: WPA3 with SAE\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in the education sector (Example: eduroam), there will be a need to have the same SSID name across all the bands with\\\\nsupport for older security mechanism like WPA/WPA2 and at the same time support for only WPA3 in 6 GHz band.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nconfigure the security settings with WPA2+ WPA3 and PMF as optional. This will make the SSID in 2.4 and 5 GHz to be\\\\ntransmitted with WPA2+WPA3 Transition Mode and PMF as Optional. The SSID will be transmitted with WPA3 Only and PMF\\\\nRequired in 6 GHz radio.\\\\n\\\\nWPA3 Transition Mode\\\\n\\\\nWLAN Security Configuration for 2.4/5 GHz - > Enable WPA3 Transition Mode (mixed mode).\\\\n\\\\n   - L2 Security would be WPA2 + WPA3.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- AKM should be set to 802.1x-SHA256 and 802.1x (SHA1).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - PMF set to optional.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.**\\\\n\\\\nWPA3 Transition Mode\\\\n\\\\n**Client-side settings**\\\\n\\\\nFor clients that do not support 6 GHz, configure a WPA2 profile.\\\\n\\\\nFor clients that support 6 GHz, configure a WPA3 Enterprise. They will use this setting to connect to both 2.4/5 GHz and 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\n**Pros:**\\\\n\\\\n   - This provides an adoption path to more secure Wi-Fi via WPA3 Transition mode.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- No new SSID profile to be managed on the client side.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n   - Older clients may have problem connecting to an SSID with WPA3 Transition mode.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:**\\\\n\\\\nThe following blog walks through the different scenarios and options available that administrators can chose to deploy depending\\\\n[on their network conditions and requirements. https://blogs.cisco.com/networking/wlan-ssid-security-migration-into-6ghz-networks.](https://blogs.cisco.com/networking/wlan-ssid-security-migration-into-6ghz-networks)\\\\n\\\\nMore details on WLAN creation can be found in the “Creating a Wi-Fi 6E WLAN” section below.\\\\n\\\\nIn Release 17.12.1, you are limited to eight Wi-Fi 6E SSIDs. However, this limit will be increased to the standard 16 SSIDs in a\\\\nfuture release This limitation affects only 6 GHz; for legacy bands you can configure up to 16 SSIDs.\\\\n\\\\n## Creating a Wi-Fi 6E WLAN\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow for creating a 6-GHz WLAN is like that for all legacy bands with only a couple of differences, one being the security\\\\nrequirement of WPA3.\\\\n\\\\nTo create a 6-GHz WLAN, navigate to Configuration > Tags and Profiles > WLANs > [Click +Add]. Input a Profile Name (WLAN\\\\nprofile identifier) and SSID (Wi-Fi name being broadcasted), and then change the Status to Enabled.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.**\\\\n\\\\nWLAN creation\\\\n\\\\nNotice that although 6 GHz is enabled, it’s highlighted in red. This is because by default, the security of WLANs is set to WPA +\\\\nWPA2, which doesn’t meet the requirement of 6 GHz. Notice that the text within the 6 GHz Status box highlights the requirements.\\\\n\\\\nTo change the security to WPA3, click the Security tab and then, from the radio button menu located at Layer2 > select WPA3.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.**\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring security parameters\\\\n\\\\nSelect at least one Authentication Key Management (AKM) option: Secure Agile Exchange (SAE), OWE, Fast Transition (FT) +\\\\n802.1X, or 802.1X-SHA256.\\\\n\\\\nNavigate back to the General tab, and you’ll notice that the 6 GHz Status is now enabled and green, meaning that all\\\\nconfigurations are satisfactory. Click Apply to Device to complete the WLAN creation workflow.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 24.**\\\\n\\\\n6-GHz radio status in WLAN\\\\n\\\\n**Option: If you want to verify that 802.11ax features such as downlink and uplink OFDMA, downlink and uplink MU-MIMO, and BSS**\\\\nTarget Wake Time are enabled, click Advanced, and scroll to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.**\\\\n\\\\nEnabling 11ax features (IOS-XE 17.12.1)\\\\n\\\\n## 6-GHz AP discovery mechanisms\\\\n\\\\nAP discovery is how wireless clients discover APs with WLANs that they would like to join. The legacy method includes two\\\\noptions, passive scanning, and active scanning.\\\\n\\\\nPassive scanning: The AP will periodically broadcast beacon frames that the wireless client can detect, providing metadata for\\\\neach WLAN the AP is broadcasting, such as the SSID name, data rates, etc.\\\\n\\\\nActive scanning: The wireless client will send probe requests to nearby APs when it wants to join a WLAN. If an AP detects this\\\\nprobe request, it will send back a probe response with WLAN information such as the SSID name, data rates, etc.\\\\n\\\\nIn both cases, using the information received from the AP in either the beacon frame or probe response, the wireless client can\\\\nrequest to join the AP’s WLAN.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.**\\\\n\\\\nLegacy AP discovery mechanisms\\\\n\\\\nThese methods worked well with the previous 2.4- and 5-GHz bandwidth networks, since 2.4 GHz had only 3x 20-MHz channels\\\\nand 5 GHz had 25x 20-MHz channels, as depicted in the figure below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nwhat we had in 5 GHz. Because wireless clients can send probe requests only on 20 MHz channels, this increases the passive\\\\nscan time significantly to 6 seconds, which is far too much delay in the world of wireless.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\nDepiction of 6-GHz spectrum\\\\n\\\\nSince legacy AP discovery mechanisms are not efficient when addressing the expanded spectrum of 6 GHz, new AP discovery\\\\nmechanisms have been created. Of these new discovery mechanisms, there are two categories, out-of-band, and in-band\\\\ndiscovery, as shown in the figure below.\\\\n\\\\nOut-of-band discovery mechanism: Used when 2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz bands all exist in the RF environment.\\\\n\\\\nIn-band discovery mechanisms: Used when only the 6-GHz band exists in the RF environment.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\n6-GHz WLAN discovery mechanisms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nFor the out-of-band discovery mechanism, we have the Reduced Neighbor Report (RNR), as depicted in the figure below, which\\\\nincludes WLAN information for all 6-GHz-capable WLANs within the beacon and probe responses of the AP’s 2.4- and 5-GHz\\\\nradios. Concatenating all 6-GHz WLAN data into these existing frames eliminates the need for additional packets to be sent, which\\\\nconserves airtime and allows the network to steer the clients toward 6 GHz if they are capable.\\\\n\\\\nRNR is enabled by default as part of 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nVisual representation of RNR\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nRNR IE shown in Wireshark\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nFast Initial Link Setup\\\\n\\\\nFor the first in-band discovery mechanism, we have the Fast Initial Link Setup (FILS) frame, which is part of the 802.11ai\\\\nstandard. A problem that exists in wireless today is APs being overwhelmed by probe requests, and this is especially true in highdensity environments. FILS directly addresses this and helps to make AP discovery in a 6-GHz band more efficient by reducing\\\\nprobe request overhead and prolonging a wireless client’s dwell time between beacon frames.\\\\n\\\\nThe following step-by-step explanation is based on the figure below.\\\\n\\\\n1. APs broadcast beacon frames that contain detailed WLAN metadata every 100 ms.\\\\n\\\\n2. If a wireless client starts WLAN discovery right after a beacon is sent, it will continuously send probe requests until the\\\\n\\\\nnext beacon is detected, taking up airtime.\\\\n\\\\n3. FILS frames, which are smaller than beacon frames, are sent every 20 ms between beacon frames and contain high-level\\\\n\\\\nWLAN information such as the short SSID name, channel, and Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT), but are\\\\nsufficient to tell a wireless client whether the WLAN is something it wants to join.\\\\n\\\\n4. If a client starts discovery right after a beacon frame is sent, within 20 ms it will detect a FILS frame. If it decides that this\\\\n\\\\nis a WLAN it would like to join, it will go into sleep mode (stop sending probe requests) until the next beacon frame is\\\\ndetected.\\\\n\\\\n5. When the next beacon frame is detected, the wireless client will use the WLAN’s detailed metadata from that frame to join\\\\n\\\\nthe WLAN.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, FILS frames help to reduce the number of probe requests being sent from clients and make the airtime more efficient.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nFILS discovery request frames shown in Wireshark\\\\n\\\\nUnsolicited Broadcast Probe Response\\\\n\\\\nThe second in-band method is the Unsolicited Broadcast Probe Response (UBPR). When this feature is enabled and a client\\\\nsends a probe request, the AP will send a probe response; however, rather than being sent to the client’s MAC address, the\\\\nprobe response is broadcasted, as the name suggests. Broadcasting the probe response enables other wireless clients to use\\\\nthis same probe response to join the WLAN, reducing probe request overhead. The UBPR frames are transmitted every 20\\\\nseconds, carry multiple BSSIDs, and contain all information needed for the association, as any normal beacon frame does.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nUBPR frames in Wireshark\\\\n\\\\nEnabling FILS or UBPR\\\\n\\\\nFILS and UBPR are equivalent greenfield, in-band, 6-GHz discovery mechanisms.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable FILS discovery or UBPR, on your Catalyst 9800 controller, navigate to Configuration > Tags and Profiles > RF/Radio >\\\\n\\\\n[Select RF profile] > 802.11ax.\\\\n\\\\nNext to 6 GHz Discovery Frames, you have the option to enable either None, Broadcast Probe Response, or FILS Discovery. The\\\\ndefault is None. If you select Broadcast Probe Response, you can also configure the response interval if desired.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 34.**\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring 6-GHz discovery on the Catalyst 9800 controller\\\\n\\\\nOnly one of these 6-GHz discovery frames methods can be enabled at a time.\\\\n\\\\n## 6-GHz radio resource management\\\\n\\\\nRadio resource management (RRM) is a collection of algorithms that allow the Catalyst 9800 controller to automatically manage\\\\nyour network through a few key features, including Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA), Preferred Scanning Channels (PSC),\\\\nDynamic Bandwidth Selection (DBS), Transmit Power Control (TPC), and Flexible Radio Assignment (FRA). This section will walk\\\\nyou through a few notable changes to RRM with the introduction of 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Channel Assignment\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) is a feature that dynamically manages channel assignments, channel width, and many other\\\\nfactors for an RF profile. It evaluates the channels for each AP radio and will automatically adjust the assigned channels based\\\\non environmental factors such as co-channel interference, rogues, noise, channel load, and DCA sensitivity. By default, this\\\\nfeature is enabled on the Catalyst 9800 controller for your 6 GHz network and the recommendation is to keep it enabled\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nYou can see a list of DCA channels in the figure below, many of which are specific to the 6-GHz band.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 35.**\\\\n\\\\n6-GHz DCA configuration in the RF profile\\\\n\\\\nFor more details on DCA, refer to the Radio Resource Management white paper: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/c\\\\nontroller/technotes/8-3/b_RRM_White_Paper/dca.html.\\\\n\\\\nPreferred Scanning Channels\\\\n\\\\nPreferred Scanning Channels (PSC) is a feature categorized under DCA that designates every fourth 20-MHz channel for active\\\\nprobing by Wi-Fi 6E clients. It is used when channels are bonded in 80 MHz and restricts scanning down to 15 channels rather\\\\nthan 59, increasing the overall efficiency of RF scanning.\\\\n\\\\nPSC enforcement is disabled by default, and the recommendation is to enable it. The PSC list is provided in the Catalyst 9800\\\\ncontroller interface at Configuration > Tags and Profiles > RF/Radio > [Select an RF Profile] > RRM > DCA, as shown in the figure\\\\nabove. When enabled, only PSC channels will be offered as the primary channel with 80-MHz channel bandwidth. The\\\\nrecommendation is to enable PSC when using 80-MHz bonded channels for more efficient network scanning from both the\\\\nwireless client and other APs in the network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 36.**\\\\n\\\\nVisual presentation of PSC\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Bandwidth Selection\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Bandwidth Selection (DBS) is a feature that is categorized under DCA. It automatically dictates the channel width of the\\\\nnetwork. For 6 GHz, it has a bias toward selecting 80-MHz channel bandwidth in countries with full 6-GHz spectrum (such as the\\\\nU.S. and South Korea) and 40 MHz in countries with partial 6-GHz spectrum. The DBS starts at 80 MHz as the default bandwidth\\\\nand will lower the bandwidth based on DCA metrics such as neighbor density, high interference, and noise floor, and if it detects\\\\nthat most clients are only 20 MHz.\\\\n\\\\nDBS is enabled by default when the Channel Width is set to Best, as shown in the figure below, and will help ensure that the most\\\\noptimal channel width is selected; no static assignment is possible. You can navigate to the window shown below on the Catalyst\\\\n9800 controller via Configuration > Tags and Profiles > RF/Radio > [Select an RF Profile] > RRM > DCA.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 37.**\\\\n\\\\nChannel Width configuration with default set to Best\\\\n\\\\nTransmit Power Control\\\\n\\\\nTransmit Power Control (TPC) automatically optimizes radios transmit (Tx) power based on neighboring RF to maximize coverage\\\\nwhile minimizing co-channel interference. The TPC algorithm is run after the convergence of DCA and DBS. When it comes to 6\\\\nGHz, it considers the Tx power increase due to the width and revised effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) adjustments on the\\\\nNeighbor Discovery Packet (NDP). The TPC algorithm also allows it to maintain a higher Tx power compared to the 2.4- and 5GHz bands due to the lower chance of co-channel interference.\\\\n\\\\nTo view the configured TPC threshold, navigate to Configuration > Tags and Profiles > RF/Radio > [Select an RF Profile] > RRM\\\\n\\\\n- TPC.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts the default but configurable thresholds of TPC. The recommendation is to leave the values at their\\\\ndefaults.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 38.**\\\\n\\\\nTPC thresholds\\\\n\\\\n## Enabling 6-GHz networks\\\\n\\\\nOFDMA is an 802.11ax feature that allows the AP to share the bandwidth resources and send out multiple packets in parallel,\\\\nwhich both maximizes the efficiency of the channel width and mitigates any network contention. With Wi-Fi 6E, OFDMA works in\\\\nthe same way, except that it has an increased spectrum to work with. By default, 6-GHz radio configurations are enabled; to verify\\\\nthis, navigate to Configuration > Radio Configuration > High Throughput.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts the different spatial stream and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) combinations, all enabled by\\\\ndefault.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 39.**\\\\n\\\\nVerifying the spatial streams and MCS of the 6-GHz configuration on a Catalyst 9800 controller\\\\n\\\\n## Configuring 6 GHz Client Steering\\\\n\\\\nSince the 6-GHz bandwidth is new, most clients will automatically associate to the AP’s 2.4- and 5-GHz radios by default. 6 GHz\\\\nClient Steering is a feature that suggests that clients on the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands join the 6-GHz band when certain criteria are\\\\nmet.\\\\n\\\\n6 GHz Client Steering is configurable at the WLAN level.\\\\n\\\\n1. Navigate to Configuration > Tags and Profiles > WLANs > [Edit existing WLAN or add new WLAN] > Advanced, then\\\\n\\\\ncheck the box next to 6 GHz Client Steering.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 40.**\\\\n\\\\nEnabling 6 GHz Client Steering\\\\n\\\\n2 N i t t C **fi** **ti** **> Wi** **l** **> Ad** **d > 6 GH Cli** **t St** **i** th fi th th h ld f 6 GH\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe configurable thresholds in the figure below include:\\\\n\\\\n   - 6 GHz Transition Minimum Client Count\\\\n\\\\n◦ The minimum number of clients that must be associated with the AP for 6 GHz Client Steering to be\\\\n\\\\ntriggered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- 6 GHz Transition Minimum Window Size\\\\n\\\\n◦ The minimum difference in wireless client count between the 6-GHz band and 2.4- or 5-GHz band.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of this threshold is to load-balance clients between different radios.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - 6 GHz Transition Maximum Utilization Difference (%)\\\\n\\\\n◦ Indicates the maximum channel utilization difference at which 6 GHz Client Steering will be triggered.\\\\n\\\\n   - 6 GHz Transition Minimum 2.4 GHz RSSI Threshold (dBm)\\\\n\\\\n◦ Indicates the minimum 2.4-GHz received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value at which 6 GHz Client\\\\n\\\\nSteering will be triggered.\\\\n\\\\n   - 6 GHz Transition Minimum 5 GHz RSSI Threshold (dBm)\\\\n\\\\n◦ Indicates the minimum 5-GHz RSSI value at which 6 GHz Client Steering will be triggered.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 41.**\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring thresholds for 6 GHz Client Steering\\\\n\\\\n## Dual 5 GHz in the Catalyst CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 42.**\\\\n\\\\nDual 5Ghz Capability on Catalyst 9166D1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n2.4, 5, and 5 GHz (dual 5 GHz) using the XOR radio capability under the following circumstances:\\\\n\\\\n   - For countries where 6-GHz spectrum is not yet available for use of Wi-Fi.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - In wireless networks, where 6-GHz client density is very minimal, and most clients are still 5 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nThe Flexible Radio Assignment (FRA) algorithm in RRM has the capability to dynamically convert the 6-GHz radio to a 5-GHz\\\\nradio when either of the above criteria are met, or to revert to 6-GHz operation when it sees more 6-GHz-capable clients joining\\\\nthe AP.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** This is not the legacy FRA available in AireOS and Catalyst 9800 Wireless LAN Controller for 2.4 and 5 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1, when operated as dual 5 GHz, offers two independent macro-macro directional cells, but focused in the\\\\nsame direction even though it’s an internal-antenna AP, which creates the simplicity of this feature. The two cells are band locked.\\\\nThe 5 GHz in slot 1 operates only in the UNII1 and 2 bands – that is, channels 36 to 64, and the XOR radio in slot 2, when\\\\noperated in 5 GHz, is locked to the UNII2E and 3 bands – that is, channels 100 to 165.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** This restriction of band lock applies only when the access point is operating as dual 5 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nThe RRM algorithm runs independently on both radios and assigns the best channel and transmit power that it comes up with.\\\\n\\\\nThe decision to change the band is based on two parameters, Client Density and Channel Utilization. By default, the FRA runs\\\\nevery 1 hour. Unlike legacy FRA, the decision to change the band is based not on a single decision, but on a collective decision\\\\nover several intervals. This is done to avoid frequent changes of radios and the resulting disruptions to client connectivity.\\\\n\\\\nThe WLC has the capability to maintain the snapshot of every run for a period of 1 week. – for a total of 168 intervals. As an\\\\nexample, if 10% of FRA decisions favor 5 GHz, the radio will be changed to 5 GHz, and if 90% favor 6 GHz, the radio will be\\\\nchanged to 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable FRA, navigate to Configuration > Radio Configurations > RRM > FRA and toggle FRA Status to “Enabled” in 5/6 GHz\\\\nFlexible Radio Assignment.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 43.**\\\\n\\\\nEnabling 5/6 GHz FRA\\\\n\\\\nIt is recommended to leave the FRA Interval and thresholds at the defaults. However, these thresholds are configurable.\\\\n\\\\nTo configure the FRA Interval, select the FRA Interval from the pull-down menu. The minimum is 1 hour and is the default value,\\\\nand the maximum is 24 hours. We recommend leaving the FRA Interval at 1 hour.\\\\n\\\\nTo change the threshold parameters, navigate to Configuration >Tags and Profiles > RF/Radio > RF > RF Profile and change the\\\\nClient Reset Count and Client Utilization Threshold. Client Reset Count indicates the number of 6-GHz-capable clients appearing\\\\non the AP, and Client Utilization Threshold indicates the load. If the threshold is above the configured parameter in an interval,\\\\nthe interval is marked as 6 GHz favorable. A similar configuration is available for 5-GHz threshold parameters.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 44.**\\\\n\\\\nFRA threshold configuration\\\\n\\\\n**Note:**\\\\n\\\\nThe 5-GHz threshold configuration can be made from the Configuration > RRM > FRA page; change the Client Select and Client\\\\nReset in 2.4/5 GHz Flexible Radio Assignment.\\\\n\\\\n**Important points**\\\\n\\\\nWhenever the Catalyst 9166D1 changes the XOR radio in slot 2 from 6 to 5 GHz and vice versa, the radios in slot 0 (2.4 GHz)\\\\nand slot 1 (5 GHz) get reset as well, resulting in client disconnect in all three radios. Due to this issue, and to avoid disruptions in\\\\nservice, band change based on an FRA decision will be skipped when:\\\\n\\\\n   - The AP is serving 10 or more clients overall in any band.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - the Load on the AP is greater than 10%.\\\\n\\\\nThe 6-GHz radio in the Catalyst CW9166D1 can also be manually converted to a 5-GHz radio. To do so, navigate to\\\\nConfiguration > Wireless > Access Points > Dual-Band Radios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 45.**\\\\n\\\\nViewing the 9166D1 5/6-GHz dual-band radio\\\\n\\\\nClick on the AP that you want to convert to dual 5-GHz mode. Under Role Assignment, choose Client Serving. From the Band\\\\nSelection drop-down menu, select 5 GHz and click Update and Apply to Device to apply the configuration to the access point.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nManual configuration of 5/6-GHz dual band in the Catalyst CW9166D1\\\\n\\\\n## 6-GHz roaming behavior\\\\n\\\\nWhen deploying APs, one wireless design consideration is roaming, or how wireless clients can seamlessly move from one AP to\\\\nanother when they physically change locations. The main thing to keep in mind is the need to support clients that do not support\\\\nWPA3 or Wi-Fi 6E. In such a scenario, clients that are currently on a 2.4- or 5-GHz band will not be able to roam to areas that\\\\ncontain only 6 GHz. Therefore, when designing your network, you may want to ensure that every access point is still broadcasting\\\\nlegacy bands with legacy security methods to ensure that there are no coverage holes for those wireless clients.\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6E client devices\\\\n\\\\nA wide variety of Wi-Fi 6E client devices are available now in the market. We recommend updating the client devices to the latest\\\\nfirmware driver. We also recommend updating the BIOS, in case the Wi-Fi 6E-capable laptop does not see the 6-GHz SSID.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWhen a Wi-Fi 6E client associates with the Catalyst CW9166D1 access point, you will be able to verify that it’s associated as a\\\\nWi-Fi 6E client by navigating to Monitoring > Wireless > Clients > [Select Wi-Fi 6E client] > 360 View.\\\\n\\\\nIn the figure below, the data next to Capabilities reads 802.11ax – 6 GHz, indicating that the wireless client is associated with the\\\\nWi-Fi 6E network.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 47.**\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6E wireless client metadata\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 can convert from the Cisco Catalyst management mode to the Meraki management mode and vice\\\\nversa. This converged hardware gives you the flexibility of on-premises or cloud management. It also provides investment\\\\nprotection for the future in case you want to switch between the two management options or between the Cisco Catalyst\\\\nmanagement mode and Meraki management mode at a later time.\\\\n\\\\nWithin the hardware itself, there are two boot partitions. The Cisco Catalyst partition will have the Cisco Catalyst image, and the\\\\nMeraki partition will contain the Meraki image. Within the device there are three saved configurations, one for each management\\\\nmode and one shared configuration that is used during the conversion.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 48.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9166D1 boot procedure\\\\n\\\\nTwo serial numbers are provided on the access point. The Meraki serial number is vertically aligned and is used for any\\\\nprocesses related to the Meraki management mode, such as claiming the device to a Meraki Dashboard account. The Cisco\\\\nCatalyst serial number is horizontally aligned and is used for any processes related to the Cisco Catalyst management mode,\\\\nsuch as Plug and Play using a Cisco Smart Account.\\\\n\\\\nThe following figure depicts the product information provided on the back of the access point.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 49.**\\\\n\\\\nDual serial numbers on the Catalyst CW9166D1 are similar to the CW9166I pictured above\\\\n\\\\n## Regulatory domain\\\\n\\\\nThere are different regulatory domains based on the specific country in which you want to use the Catalyst CW9162I, CW9164I,\\\\nor CW9166I.

Make sure to set -ROW Access Point countries in the AP join profile and as a global configuration to properly migrate to\\\\n\\\\nthe correct country.\\\\n\\\\na.  Example: -ROW with AP join profile and global set to US. During migration, the country is set as AE.\\\\n\\\\n2. The controller will match the regulatory domain of the access point and global AP countries when using multiple different\\\\n\\\\nregulatory domains in the global settings.\\\\n\\\\na  Example 1: -E with AP join profile US and Global config set as US and France. During migration, the country is set as FR.\\\\n\\\\nb.  Example 2: -B AP with AP profile as France and Global config set as US and France. During migration, the country is set as US.\\\\n\\\\n## Analytics and RF visibility\\\\n\\\\n Cisco CleanAir Pro and the AI/ML-driven scanning radio\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6E (6 GHz) was introduced with the Catalyst 9136I, and with it came new challenges for RF visibility and much more\\\\nspectrum to monitor. In the past, the Catalyst 9100 APs relied on Cisco CleanAir[®] (software) and the RF-ASIC (hardware) for\\\\nfeatures such as packet capture, spectrum analysis, interference detection, and rogue and wireless intrusion prevention system\\\\n(WIPS) detection. CleanAir and the RF-ASIC were great for RF visibility for the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands; however, with 6 GHz, Cisco\\\\nCleanAir Pro and the AI/ML-driven scanning radio are being introduced to increase the performance and granularity required to\\\\nmanage this new spectrum (all 1200 MHz of it).\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir Pro is software designed specifically for 6 GHz and the all-new challenges that have come with the introduction of 1200\\\\nMHz of spectrum. While many features work in conjunction with the AI/ML-driven scanning radio, CleanAir Pro also works with the\\\\nCatalyst 9611D1 APs’ serving radios. Unlike previous generations of APs, CleanAir Pro can even decode high-efficiency (HE,\\\\n802.11ax) frames, which is crucial since Wi-Fi 6E uses only HE frames. In the future, there will even be an ML-based interferer\\\\nclassification built directly into the AP software for more efficient interferer analysis, rather than loading the WLC or Cisco Catalyst\\\\nCenter.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 58.**\\\\n\\\\nHigh-level comparison of CleanAir Pro and CleanAir\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst Center is Cisco’s network monitoring software, for everything related to analytics. With the introduction of Wi-Fi 6E,\\\\nCisco Catalyst Center Release 2.3.2 will support 6 GHz from all perspectives. This includes the Wi-Fi 6E dashboard, Intelligent\\\\nCapture for packet capture and spectrum analysis on 6 GHz, rogue and aWIPS detection on 6 GHz, and many others.\\\\n\\\\nThe following are a few examples of the features on Cisco Catalyst Center related to Wi-Fi 6E.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 59.**\\\\n\\\\nWi-Fi 6/6E dashboard: View network readiness and benefits for Wi-Fi 6/6E\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 60.**\\\\n\\\\nSpectrum analysis: Visualize RF spectrum energy, not only for 2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz bands.\\\\n\\\\nSpectrum analysis is part of the Intelligent Capture feature set.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 61.**\\\\n\\\\nData packet capture: Capture unencrypted data packets.\\\\n\\\\nData packet capture is part of the Intelligent Capture feature set.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 62.**\\\\n\\\\nRogue management and aWIPS: Detects wireless threats in the environment, not only for 2.4 and 5 GHz, but now also for 6 GHz.\\\\n\\\\n**Rogue management and aWIPS dashboard**\\\\n\\\\n**Note:**\\\\n\\\\n   - Refer to the “Software Solution Compatibility” section in this guide for the exact features released with Cisco IOS XE 17.9.1\\\\n\\\\nand Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.4.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   - Please refer to the Cisco Catalyst Center user guide for a detailed overview.\\\\n\\\\n## Internet of Things integration\\\\n\\\\n Environmental sensors and IoT Services with Cisco Spaces\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 has three built-in environmental sensors, air quality, humidity, and temperature, that will be integrated\\\\nwith Cisco Spaces’ rich map.

A user can create IETF telemetry subscriptions in the WLC to send telemetry data to a receiver such as Telegraf.\\\\nThe receiver will then be able to get the environmental sensor data or BLE device data from the WLC and send that data to the\\\\nappropriate forums for use.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts how BLE data is sent from the Catalyst CW9166D1 to a wireless controller and then to an administrator.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 77.**\\\\n\\\\nModel-driven telemetry\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts an example of how to create an IETF telemetry subscription on the wireless controller.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 78.**\\\\n\\\\nWireless controller IETF telemetry subscription example\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**telemetry ietf subscription 20: This is the subscription ID that groups together all the config to stream one set of data.**\\\\n\\\\n**encoding encode-kvgpb: This matches the encoding specified inside “cisco_telemetry_mdt” that is used by the receiver.**\\\\nKVGPB stands for Key Value Google Protocol Buffer.\\\\n\\\\n**filter xpath /wireless-access-point-oper:access-point-oper-data/ap-temp: This is the data we want to send; it is the xpath**\\\\nfor the AP temperature data.\\\\n\\\\n**source-address 172.16.99.3: This is where we want to send the data from, that is, the wireless controller’s management**\\\\ninterface.\\\\n\\\\n**stream yang-push: Stream the data using YANG.**\\\\n\\\\n**update-policy periodic 5000: Send new data every 5 seconds.**\\\\n\\\\n**receiver ip address 172.16.99.3 57500 protocol grpc-tcp: Send the data to the receiver (172.16.99.3) on the port that**\\\\nreceiver is listening on (TCP 57500) using grpc-tcp.\\\\n\\\\nWe can similarly create this subscription for other data coming from the wireless controller, including the air quality data and BLE\\\\ndata.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts how to enable the environmental sensors on an AP join profile.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 79.**\\\\n\\\\nTelemetry data AP profile configuration\\\\n\\\\nOnce the air quality and temperature sensor are enabled, the user can create IETF telemetry subscriptions pointing to their\\\\nspecific receiver and be able to get the raw data coming from the environmental sensors.\\\\n\\\\nThe xpath for the air quality data is: /wireless-access-point-oper:access-point-oper-data/ap-air-quality\\\\n\\\\nThe xpath for the temperature data is: wireless-access-point-oper:access-point-oper-data/ap-temp\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts sample temperature data coming from the Catalyst 9800 wireless controller and collected from the\\\\nCatalyst 9166I environmental sensor.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 80.**\\\\n\\\\nTemperature telemetry data output\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts sample air quality data coming from the Catalyst 9800 wireless controller and collected from the Catalyst\\\\nCW9166D1 environmental sensor.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 81.**\\\\n\\\\nAir quality telemetry data output\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 82.**\\\\n\\\\nEnabling the BLE radio on the wireless controller\\\\n\\\\nOnce the BLE radio is enabled on the wireless controller and the access point, the user can create IETF telemetry subscriptions\\\\npointing to their specific receiver and be able to get the raw data coming from the surrounding BLE sensors that are scanned by\\\\nthe access point’s BLE radio.\\\\n\\\\nThe xpath for the BLE data is: wireless-ble-ltx-oper:ble-ltx-oper-data/ble-ltx-ap-streaming.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts sample BLE data coming from the Catalyst 9800 wireless controller and collected from the Catalyst\\\\nCW9166D1 IoT radio.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 83.**\\\\n\\\\nBLE telemetry data output\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on programmability and model-driven telemetry, refer to the configuration guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/\\\\nus/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/178/b_178_programmability_cg/m_178_prog_ietf_telemetry.html.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst CW9166D1 allow users to load Cisco IOx applications onto the platform to solve IoT use cases by acting as an IoT\\\\ngateway. These IOx applications can communicate with an RF-USB dongle connected to the USB port of the AP and talk to the\\\\nsurrounding IoT devices. IoT device data is then sent through the AP and to a back-end server. With the Catalyst CW9166D1,\\\\nthe USB port outputs a total of 4.5 watts of power.\\\\n\\\\nUse cases for application hosting include retail management with electronic shelf labels, asset management with environmental\\\\nsensors and real-time location, and medical management with tracking of patient vitals.\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below depicts the basic topology of application hosting with the Catalyst CW9166D1.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 84.**\\\\n\\\\nApplication hosting\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the IOx framework on the Catalyst CW9166D1 is available starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 17.12.1 and Cisco\\\\nCatalyst Center Release 2.3.7.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on application hosting, refer to the deployment guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wirel\\\\ness/access-points/guide-c07-744305.html.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9166D1 has support for a new mode called Site Survey. The purpose of this mode is to allow users to conduct\\\\nwireless site survey testing using a single access point, including understanding RF propagation, client join metrics, and so on,\\\\nwithout the need for a controller. This mode converts the AP into a limited standalone mode, enabling it to broadcast 2.4-, 5-, and\\\\n6-GHz SSIDs. Site Survey mode provides all the control needed to configure and conduct a site survey while reducing the\\\\nadditional equipment required to a power source (battery or PoE switch port). It lets users bring the AP into any environment with\\\\neither a power source or battery backup and conduct a site survey test.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Catalyst CW9166D1 is in Site Survey mode, you will be able to access the AP’s WebUI for each configuration and view\\\\nvarious RF metrics for RF coverage and planning.\\\\n\\\\nThese configurations include channel number, channel width, Tx power, SSID, and data rates.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 85.**\\\\n\\\\nConfiguration page of the Catalyst CW9166D1 in Site Survey mode\\\\n\\\\nThe steps below describe how to convert a Catalyst 9166D1 AP into Site Survey mode:\\\\n\\\\n1. Change the AP to Site Survey mode (Run command on the AP’s CLI): ap-type site-survey\\\\n\\\\n2. After booting up, the AP is automatically assigned a static IP of 10.0.23.1.\\\\n\\\\n3. The AP will start broadcasting the C9166_site_survey SSID.\\\\n\\\\n4. Connect your wireless client with the C9166_site_survey SSID and it will receive an IP from 10.0.23.0/24.\\\\n\\\\n5. Access the AP’s Site Survey WebUI via 10.0.23.1.\\\\n\\\\n6. The first time, the default username and password are admin/admin. You will be directed to reset that insecure password\\\\n\\\\non the first login.\\\\n\\\\n7. When done, convert your AP back to CAPWAP mode to join the controller again (AP CLI): ap-type capwap\\\\n\\\\nIf an AP is converted to Site Survey mode while connected to a WLC, it will disjoin and go into standalone mode. s\\\\n\\\\n## Software solution compatibility\\\\n\\\\nThis section lists the software features and their versions compatible with the Cisco Catalyst 9166D1 access

This next-generation Wi-Fi is all\\\\nabout high-efficiency wireless (getting the most out of every packet that is on the air) in a way that improves the user experience.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Next-generation Wi-Fi 6\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** 802.11ax improvements\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.** Differences between 802.11ac and 802.11ax\\\\n\\\\nChoosing the right access point\\\\n\\\\nModels\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 4.** Features of the Cisco Catalyst 9115 and 91117AX Series Access Points\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9115 Series has models supporting internal (AXI) and external (AXE) antenna options. The 9115E model is ideal in areas where\\\\nexternal antennas are already deployed or where a directional antenna is desired.\\\\n\\\\nThe internal antenna versions (9115I and 9117I) are ideal for carpeted areas where ceiling installations are desirable.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.** Choosing an integrated antenna or an external antenna\\\\n\\\\nAccess point physical hardware and mounting options\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.** Cisco Catalyst 9115 Series mechanicals\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.** Cisco Catalyst 9115 Series mechanicals (continued)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.** Cisco Catalyst 9117 Series mechanicals (continued)\\\\n\\\\nMany different installation options are available, depending on the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from Cisco as well as thirdparty companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each bracket is a zero-dollar ($0) option at\\\\nthe time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the default is AIR-AP-BRACKET-1, which is the most popular for ceiling\\\\ninstallations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 (Figure 10).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.** Brackets available for mounting access points\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, the AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 mounts flush and has the lowest profile. However, if the\\\\naccess point will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, or inside a NEMA-rated enclosure or perhaps wall mounted, the AIR-APBRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in the bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes line up with many popular electrical boxes. When the\\\\nbracket is mounted to the ceiling gridwork, the clips used will depend on whether the ceiling tiles are recessed. Two different styles of ceiling clips,\\\\nrecessed and flush rails, are available (Figure 11).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.** Ceiling clips\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng g g\\\\n\\\\nIt comes in a 2-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip shown in Figure 11. Refer to Figures 13 and 14.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.** Examples of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.** AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.** AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall mounting the access point\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be a physical obstacle to the wireless signal; therefore, 360-degree\\\\ncoverage may be compromised by the wall. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a 180-degree pattern instead, a\\\\ndirectional antenna often referred to as a “patch” antenna may be a better choice, assuming that the external antenna access point model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall-mounting access points with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party vendors), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage. See Figure 15.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.** Wall-mount options\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is wall mounted in a non-ceiling orientation, the signal may penetrate the floors above and below, causing unintended coverage that\\\\ncould result in additional, needless roaming access when a mobility client, such as a user with a Wi-Fi phone, walks by on an adjacent floor.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.** Wall mounting access points with internal antennas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nChanging the color of an access point\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to change the color of an access point, rather than painting the access point, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl\\\\ntape or a colored plastic cover from Oberon (Figure 17).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.** Third-party option for changing the color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.** AccelTex “skins” for access points\\\\n\\\\nUnique installations\\\\n\\\\nClean rooms (healthcare)\\\\n\\\\nMany hospitals and factories have requirements to wipe down or gently spray the environment with a chemical (often a diluted solution that has cleaning\\\\nand disinfectant properties).\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst access points can be wiped down using a Steris product called Spor-Klenz.\\\\n\\\\nIf the clean room environment requires metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be used\\\\n(Figure 19).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.** Oberon metal enclosure protects and secures the access point in clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9115 and 9117 Series are rated for installation in the plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the access point so\\\\nthat nothing is visible on the ceiling. In some cases this is preferred for aesthetic reasons, so customers may install the access point above a drop\\\\nceiling. This also may be preferred in high-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing be visible on the ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hanger accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used (Figure 20).\\\\nThe Erico Caddy 512a or the Cooper B-Line BA50a or similar T-bar grid hangers can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.erico.com](http://www.erico.com)\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.cooperindustries.com](http://www.cooperindustries.com)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.** Example of hanging an access point above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Note: Installing access points above the ceiling tiles should be done only when mounting below the ceiling is not an option. The tiles must not**\\\\nbe conductive; such installations can degrade advanced RF features such as voice and location, so verify coverage and performance. Always try to\\\\nmount the access point as close to the inside middle of the tile as possible, and avoid areas with obstructions (Figure 21).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.** Installing an access point above ceiling tiles: Pick an area clear of obstructions, and avoid ceiling clutter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng y y g\\\\n\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note: Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA-rated enclosure (Figure 22). This varies by country; for example,**\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit NEMA-rated access point enclosures if the access point is indoors, such as in a freezer, but may prohibit their use\\\\noutdoors. This seems to vary with regard to weather radar compliance and often UNII-1 compliance, etc. Check with your Cisco account team or the\\\\ncommunications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.** Example of NEMA 16x14x8 enclosure with pressure vent on bottom\\\\n\\\\nThird-party sources for NEMA-rated enclosures include:\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.oberonwireless.com](https://www.oberonwireless.com)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.acceltex.com](https://www.acceltex.com)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.terra-wave.com](https://www.terra-wave.com)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-rated enclosure, try to have the cables exit from the bottom of the enclosure, so that rain and moisture do not run down the cable\\\\ninto the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating; for example, a black enclosure will get much hotter in the sun than a white\\\\none.\\\\n\\\\nYou may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nAreas with high vibration\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is installed using a “side arm” type mount or other mounting location where there is a likelihood of high vibration, it is recommended\\\\nthat a padlock or metal pin be used to prevent the access point from vibrating loose from the bracket (Figure 23).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.** A metal pin or padlock will not deteriorate over time, so it is a better option than a plastic tie\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse and factory environments\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of material being stored. When performing a coverage check\\\\n(site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels, as the material being stored can change the RF coverage, creating loss of uniform\\\\ncoverage. Also, try to position the access points as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the antennas when it is practical to do so. If the\\\\naccess point is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, in the best case scenario. When configuring coverage for aisles, try to use\\\\ndirectional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain omnidirectional antennas on the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units\\\\nwith integrated antennas, as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to have more nulls. See Figure 24.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the access point lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example in Figure 24.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 24.** Access point placement in a warehouse environment (an external dipole “E” or internal antenna “I” could be used)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting an access point at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to the\\\\nholes of most electrical boxes (Figure 25). Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.** Mounting an access point onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nEthernet cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhile the 9115 and 9117 Series access points will work fine with Category 5e for new cable installations, it is recommended that customers use\\\\nCategory 6a, as this is the cabling required by the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard.\\\\n\\\\nAntenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical and possible, keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low-Loss (LL) and Ultra-Low-Loss (ULL) cables, which\\\\nhave the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nPart numbers for Cisco cables consist of “AIR-CAB” and then a length. For example, a 20-foot length of LL cable with an RP-TNC connector is Cisco\\\\nAIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing areas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.** When drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically 5/8 inch)\\\\n\\\\nA i t i d ti\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\noperate in the unlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB — that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space them farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges —for example, frequency-hopping legacy access\\\\npoints or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the access point (think below or above the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands) — you should\\\\nconsider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference by testing both\\\\ndevices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much, if any, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\n**Warning: In order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located at a minimum of 7.9 inches (20 cm) or more**\\\\nfrom the body of all persons. See the installation guide under declaration of conformity for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in IDF closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing access points near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas, and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route electrical wiring or Ethernet cables in the near field (6 to 15 inches) of the antenna. Try to refrain\\\\nfrom installing the access point in the electrical closet, as the best place for the access point is as close to the users as possible and practical. If you\\\\nremote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire and safety regulations for more on this).\\\\n\\\\nThe following URLs will help you understand interference:\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing access points in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is important to\\\\ncheck the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is only a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging, since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of access points rather\\\\nquickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna on the bottom of\\\\nthe elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\npersons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas.\\\\n\\\\nExternal antenna options and patterns\\\\n\\\\nFor use with the Cisco Catalyst 9115E Access Point\\\\n\\\\nThe 9115E external antenna access point is compatible with the Cisco antennas listed in Table 1.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Cisco antennas for use with the 9115E\\\\n\\\\nIndoor Access Point – Approved Antenna options\\\\n\\\\n**Product ID** **Description** **Gain**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2524DB-R/= 2.4 GHz 2 dBi/5 GHz 4 dBi Dipole Ant., Black, connectors RP-TNC 2 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n4 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2524DG-R/= 2.4 GHz 2 dBi/5 GHz 4 dBi Dipole Ant., Gray, connectors RP-TNC 2 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n4 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2524DW-R/= 2.4 GHz 2 dBi/5 GHz 4 dBi Dipole Ant., White, connectors RP-TNC 2 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n4 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2535SDW-R 2.4 GHz 3 dBi/5 GHz 5 dBi Low Profile Antenna, White, connectors RP-TNC 3 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n5 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2566P4W-R= 2.4 GHz 6 dBi/5 GHz 6 dBi Directionnel Ant., 4-port, connectors RP-TNC 6 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n6 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2524V4C-R= 2.4 GHz 2 dBi/5 GHz 4 dBi Ceiling Mount Omni Ant., 4-port, connectors RP-TNC 2 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n4 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2544V4M-R= 2.4 GHz 4 dBi/5 GHz 4 dBi Wall Mount Omni Ant., 4-port, connectors RP-TNC 4 dBi (2.4 GHz)\\\\n4 dBi (5 GHz)\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2566D4M-R= 2.4 GHz 6 dBi/5 GHz 6 dBi 60 Deg.

Cisco Catalyst 9117 5-GHzmicrocell antenna pattern**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 43.** Cisco Catalyst 9117 BLE antenna system\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding external antenna deployments\\\\n\\\\nAll Cisco antenna connectors are labeled “A,” “B,” “C,” and so on. “A” has a higher priority than “B” or “C/D,” so if the access point supports, say, three\\\\nor four antennas, and you have only two antennas, you would use them on ports “A” and “B” (for the short term, until you could install the additional\\\\nantennas).\\\\n\\\\nWhile it is not recommended that you use fewer antennas, the product (in a pinch) would support 802.11a/b/g clients or single-spatial-stream N clients\\\\nusing only one or two antennas. However, there is a significant performance hit and you would lose beamforming and key 802.11ax\\\\n**functionality. Should you do this, you would also want to configure the access point software to not use the other antennas.**\\\\n\\\\nThe following applies when using a MIMO (dual-radiating element) antenna such as:\\\\n\\\\nAIR-ANT2524V4C-R: Dual-band omnidirectional – 2/4 dBi ceiling-mount omni use\\\\nAIR-ANT2544V4M-R: Dual-band omnidirectional – 4/4 dBi wall-mount omni use\\\\nAIR-ANT2566P4W-R: Dual-band directional – 6 dBi patch wall-mount use\\\\n\\\\nWith these antennas, it is not critical which antenna lead goes onto which antenna port on the access point, so long as all the antenna ports on the\\\\naccess point are connected to the antennas. In the case of the patch antenna AIR-ANT2566P4W-R, since the elements are spaced physically apart\\\\n(side by side) in the plastic housing, there is a slight improvement if you use the outer two elements on the patch on ports “A” and “B,” but again it is\\\\nonly a small improvement and not critical (Figure 44). That is why we do not label them.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 44.** Patch antenna leads\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 45.** Antenna spacing\\\\n\\\\nAvoid spacing antennas more than 10 feet apart (antennas should be in same RF coverage area).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 46.** In areas where high amounts of metal are present, a site survey is required\\\\n\\\\nWhen using 802.11n/ac/ax rates in areas with a high level of metal, such as distribution areas or airport hangars, sometimes lower-gain antennas (on\\\\nthe ceiling) can perform better, as these antennas tend to radiate the signal in all directions, increasing the chance that multipath will enhance the\\\\nsignal. Of course, if you have a clear shot, a patch antenna at the end of an aisle at roughly the same height as or just above the WLAN client is\\\\npreferred.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ny\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** Cisco Catalyst 9115 Series power requirements\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9115 Series power requirements\\\\n\\\\n802.3at Full Feature\\\\n\\\\n**Power Source** **Power Type** **2.4GHz Radio** **5GHz Radio**\\\\n\\\\n802.3at PoE 4x4 4x4\\\\n\\\\n802.3af Reduced Feature\\\\n\\\\n**Power Source** **Power Type** **2.4GHz Radio** **5GHz Radio**\\\\n\\\\n802.3af PoE 2x2 2x2\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** Cisco Catalyst 9117 Series power requirements\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst Catalyst 9117 Series power requirements\\\\n\\\\n802.3bt/ Cisco UPoE+, Cisco UPoE Full Feature\\\\n\\\\n**Power Source** **Power Type** **2.4GHz Radio**\\\\n\\\\n802.3bt/UPoE+, UPoE PoE 4x4 8x8\\\\n\\\\n802.3at Full Feature[*]\\\\n\\\\n**Power Source** **Power Type** **2.4GHz Radio** **5GHz Radio**\\\\n\\\\n802.3at PoE 4x4 8x8\\\\n\\\\n802.3af Reduced Feature\\\\n\\\\n**Power Source** **Power Type** **2.4GHz Radio** **5GHz Radio**\\\\n\\\\n802.3af PoE 2x2 2x2\\\\n\\\\n- = USB port can be enabled, but 5GHz Radio reduced to 4x4\\\\n\\\\nCisco has a line of Multigigabit products that can easily power these access points.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 47.** Cisco Catalyst Multigigabit switches\\\\n\\\\nGeneral considerations regarding access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding all access points.\\\\n\\\\n|Power Source|Power Type|2.4GHz Radio|5GHz Radio|Link Speed|USB|LLDP|CDP|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|802.3at|PoE|4x4|4x4|2.5G|Y|20.4W|20.4W|\\\\n\\\\n|Power Source|Power Type|2.4GHz Radio|5GHz Radio|Link Speed|USB|LLDP|CDP|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|802.3af|PoE|2x2|2x2|1G|N|15.4W|15.4W|\\\\n\\\\n|Power Source|Power Type|2.4GHz Radio|5GHz Radio|Link Speed|USB|LLDP|CDP|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|802.3bt/UPoE+, UPoE|PoE|4x4|8x8|5G|Y|28.9W|34.2W|\\\\n\\\\n|Power Source|Power Type|2.4GHz Radio|5GHz Radio|Link Speed|USB|LLDP|CDP|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|802.3at|PoE|4x4|8x8|5G|N|25.4W|30.0W|\\\\n\\\\n|Power Source|Power Type|2.4GHz Radio|5GHz Radio|Link Speed|USB|LLDP|CDP|\\\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n|802.3af|PoE|2x2|2x2|2.5G|N|15.4W|15.4W|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Always try to mount the access point as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment; for example, hospitals\\\\n\\\\nhave metal doors, and coverage can change when the doors close. Old buildings can have metal gridwork in the plaster, or asbestos can be\\\\npresent. Avoid mounting the access point or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area.\\\\n\\\\n  - When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1, 6, 11 channel scheme is used as in the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting all of the access\\\\n\\\\npoints on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can (Figure 48). See our other deployment guides for more on this topic.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 48.** Example of channel usage in 2.4 and 5 GHz (two channels used if 40 MHz)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n   - Try to determine which clients are going to be used, and check the coverage using those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might not\\\\n\\\\nhave the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip: Verify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n   - While site surveys are generally recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco Radio Resource Management (RRM) is in place,\\\\n\\\\nsometimes a limited site survey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. For very challenging environments, such as train connectivity,\\\\noil and gas facilities, large hospitals, etc., Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform\\\\nyour installation.

This\\\\ncombination provides deployment flexibility while offering best-in-class performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Business 145AC Access Point\\\\n\\\\n## Features and benefits\\\\n\\\\nBy adhering to the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard, the Cisco Business 145AC Access Point delivers a data rate of up to 867 Mbps\\\\non its 5-GHz radio. This exceeds the data rates offered by access points that support the 802.11n standard. It also enables a\\\\ntotal aggregate dual-radio data rate of up to 1 Gbps, providing the necessary foundation for small business and Managed\\\\nService Providers (MSPs) to stay ahead of the performance expectations and needs of their wireless users.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, small businesses, enterprises, and managed service providers alike have increasingly preferred wireless access\\\\nas the principal form of network connectivity. Along with this shift, there is an expectation that wireless should enable a highperformance experience. The Cisco Business 145AC Access Point delivers industry-leading performance with highly secure and\\\\nreliable wireless connections, for a robust, mobile end-user experience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and benefits\\\\n\\\\nFeature Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**MU‑MIMO** Multi-User (MU) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technology allows transmission of data to\\\\nmultiple 802.11ac Wave 2–capable clients simultaneously to improve the client experience. Prior to MUMIMO, 802.11n and 802.11ac Wave 1 access points could transmit data to only one client at a time. This\\\\nwas typically referred to as Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO).\\\\n\\\\n**Gigabit** Three local Gigabit Ethernet ports are available to securely connect wired devices to the network. Traffic\\\\n**Ethernet** from wired devices can be tunneled back to Master AP or be locally switched by the access point. One of\\\\n**ports** these Ethernet ports can also provide Power over Ethernet (PoE) out to power a device such as an IP\\\\n\\\\nphone or a security camera.\\\\n\\\\n**Simplified** Deploy and configure multiple Cisco Business access points and mesh extenders easily without a physical\\\\n**management** controller, using Cisco Business Mobile app. Optional multisite remote management is available through\\\\n\\\\nthe Cisco FindIT Network Management.\\\\n\\\\n**Mesh** Mix and match Cisco Business mesh extenders or access points to increase WiFi coverage throughout\\\\n**technology** your business.\\\\n**support**\\\\n\\\\n**Flexible** Flexible deployment models supporting multiple concurrent use cases required by small businesses,\\\\n**deployment** including point of sale systems, surveillance cameras, guest access, and more.\\\\n\\\\n## Prominent features\\\\n\\\\nIncreased wireless performance\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Business 145AC Access Point supports the latest 802.11ac Wave 2 standard for higher performance, greater access,\\\\nand higher-density networks. With simultaneous dual radios and dual bands with 802.11ac Wave 2 MU-MIMO functionality, this\\\\naccess point can handle the increasing number of high-bandwidth devices that will soon become a common part of the network.\\\\n\\\\nCisco Business Mobile app\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Business 145AC Access Point is managed by the Cisco Business Mobile app, an intuitive client application that\\\\nsimplifies traditional challenges associated with wireless network deployment, right from your mobile device. You can extend your\\\\nnetwork by adding new mesh extenders and automating wireless network activation in minutes. A robust management capability\\\\ndynamically changes network configuration such as enabling guest access. Network usage, traffic patterns, and network\\\\nthroughput can be closely monitored, providing a real-time snapshot; this not only provides peace of mind, it virtually ensures\\\\noptimal user experience. The Cisco Business Mobile app is available for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.\\\\n\\\\nWired access\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Business 145AC Access Point allows wired access via a single Gigabit Ethernet port. It supports full operation modes\\\\nusing PoE 802.3af power. The 145AC comes with three local Gigabit Ethernet ports, one uplink Gigabit Ethernet port, and one\\\\npassive pass-through RJ-45 port, allowing for a variety of connections.\\\\n\\\\nMounting\\\\n\\\\nThis compact access point is designed with flexible mounting options in mind. You can mount it directly on the wall or to\\\\nnumerous global wall junction standards. It is easy to install, and the mounting hardware is included.\\\\n\\\\n## Product specifications\\\\n\\\\nTable 2 lists the specifications for the Cisco Business 145AC Access Point.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** Specifications\\\\n\\\\nItem Specification\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Maximum number of**\\\\n**nonoverlapping channels**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**A (A regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.462 GHz; 11 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.700 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n(excludes 5.600 to 5.640 GHz)\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.825 GHz; 5 channels\\\\n\\\\n**B (B regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.462 GHz; 11 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.720 GHz; 12 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.825 GHz; 5 channels\\\\n\\\\n**C (C regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**K (K regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.620 GHz; 7 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.805 GHz; 4 channels\\\\n\\\\n**N (N regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**D (D regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Q (Q regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**E (E regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.700 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n(excludes 5.600 to 5.640 GHz)\\\\n\\\\n**F (F regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.805 GHz; 4 channels\\\\n\\\\n**G (G regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**R (R regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.660 to 5.700 GHz; 3 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.805 GHz; 4 channels\\\\n\\\\n**S (S regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.700 GHz; 11 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.825 GHz; 5 channels\\\\n\\\\n**T (T regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.462 GHz; 11 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.280 to 5.320 GHz; 3 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.700 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n(excludes 5.600 to 5.640 GHz)\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.825 GHz; 5 channels\\\\n\\\\n**Z (Z regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.462 GHz; 11 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.500 to 5.700 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n(excludes 5.600 to 5.640 GHz)\\\\n\\\\n- 5.745 to 5.825 GHz; 5 channels\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**H (H regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n- 2.412 to 2.472 GHz; 13 channels\\\\n\\\\n- 5.180 to 5.320 GHz; 8 channels\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**I (I regulatory domain):**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Note: The maximum power setting will vary by channel and according to individual country regulations.

While incorporating\\\\nseveral high-performance features, the hardware has been redesigned to deliver greater efficiencies in a more compact form factor to\\\\nmake visually appealing Wi-Fi deployments commonplace.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.**\\\\n\\\\nMechanicals: 9130I model\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.**\\\\n\\\\nMechanicals: 9130E model\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9130 Series is approximately 13 percent lighter and has 25 percent lower volume than the Cisco Aironet[®] 2800 Series, yet is\\\\neasy to deploy using the same AIR-BRACKET-1 and AIR-BRACKET-2 mounting hardware.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nMany different installation options are available, depending upon the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from Cisco as\\\\nwell as third-party companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each bracket is a\\\\nzero-dollar ($0) option at the time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the default is AIR-AP-BRACKET-1, which is\\\\nthe most popular for ceiling installations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-AP-BRACKET-2.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 4.**\\\\n\\\\nTwo different types of mounting brackets\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, the AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 bracket mounts flush and has the lowest profile.\\\\nHowever, if the AP will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, inside a National Electrical Manufactuers Association (NEMA)\\\\nenclosure, or on a wall, AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in this bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes line up\\\\nwith many popular electrical boxes. When the bracket is mounted to the ceiling gridwork, some ceiling tiles are recessed. For this reason,\\\\ntwo different styles of ceiling clips, recessed and flush rails, are available. See the figure below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nClips for attaching to ceiling gridwork\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nSecuring the AP\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP needs to be secured in the bracket, it can be done as shown in the figure above.\\\\n\\\\n## Channel rail adapters\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting APs to ceiling channel rails such as the ones shown in the figure below, an optional channel adapter is used: AIR-CHNLADAPTER. It comes in a two-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip. Refer to Figures 8 and 9.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall-mounting the AP\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be physical obstacles to the wireless signal; therefore, the\\\\nability to maintain 360-degree coverage may be compromised. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a 180degree pattern instead, a directional antenna, often referred to as a “patch” antenna, may be a better choice, assuming that the external\\\\nantenna model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall-mounting APs with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party companies), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex wall-mounting solutions for 9115AX, 9117AX, 9120AX, and 9130 Series access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following third-party companies are recommended for different types of mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n[Oberon](http://www.oberoninc.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[AccelTex](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[Ventev](http://www.ventev.com/)\\\\n\\\\nIf wall-mounted in a non-ceiling orientation, the signal may penetrate the floor above and below, causing unintended coverage that could\\\\nresult in additional needless roaming access when a mobility client (for example a user with a Wi-Fi phone) walks by on an adjacent floor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCaveats when wall mounting the 9130 Series\\\\n\\\\nChanging the color of an AP\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a desire to change the color of an AP, rather than painting it, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl tape or\\\\na colored plastic cover from Oberon.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon third-party option for changing the AP color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nVinyl “skins” from AccelTex\\\\n\\\\nAnother third-party option is a vinyl “skin” such as the ones shown above.\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9130I and 9130E are rated for installation in the plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the AP so\\\\nthat nothing is visible on the ceiling, for aesthetic reasons. If so, you may install the AP above a drop ceiling. This also may be preferred in\\\\nhigh-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing can be visible on the ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hanger accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used.\\\\nThe Erico Caddy 512a, the Cooper B-Line BA50a, or similar T-bar grid can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[Erico](http://www.erico.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[Eaton](http://www.cooperindustries.com/)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of how to hang an AP above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Installing APs above the ceiling tiles should be done only when mounting below the ceiling is not an option.

This analytics radio enhances the performance of the access points’\\\\nclient-serving radios, as all this deep RF analysis is done on the RF ASIC.\\\\n\\\\nThe function of the Cisco RF ASIC (actually two ASIC chips) is to analyze a frequency or range of frequencies of interest, converting the\\\\nreceived RF signal into quadrature signals known as I/Q data. This I/Q data is then passed on to a second ASIC that is a dedicated\\\\nbaseband processor for a deep RF analysis, such as determining granular changes in the phase and amplitude as well as the modulation\\\\ncharacteristics of the inspected signal.\\\\n\\\\nThe I/Q data is evaluated by the Spectrum Analysis Engine (SAgE), which is custom designed to identify sources of non-Wi-Fi interference,\\\\nat the highest resolution, in the most simple and effective way.\\\\n\\\\nThink of the RF ASIC as a unique piece of hardware that not only contains CleanAir and SAgE but is also much more advanced and has\\\\nthe capability to support advanced features in the future with software upgrades.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\np p p y y\\\\n\\\\n(Radio Resource Management) by providing off-channel analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I with the Cisco RF ASIC chip\\\\n\\\\n## Cisco Catalyst 9130I internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\n9130I internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\nThe 9130I has one of the most advanced antenna systems available on an access point.\\\\n\\\\nThe main serving radios default to this configuration:\\\\n\\\\n  - A dedicated 5-GHz radio is tied to the dual-band client-serving antennas at 4 dBi.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- When in 5-GHz 8x8 mode, the four dual-band antennas and the four micro antennas are fully used, while the 2.4-GHz radio is also\\\\n\\\\nactive in 4x4 mode using the dual-band antennas.\\\\n\\\\n- Unlike in previous models, the (eXclusive OR) known as XOR radio is no longer tied to the 2.4-GHz radio (which is active regardless of\\\\n\\\\nXoR state).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - In dual 5-GHz mode, the 8x8 5-GHz radio changes state from 8x8 to 4x4, enabling a secondary 5-GHz radio to run independently on\\\\n\\\\nthe micro antennas for a true dual micro/macro cell approach.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the serving radio antennas, there are two other antennas:\\\\n\\\\n  - BLE (IoT) antenna with a gain of 2.5 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - RF ASIC antenna with a gain of 2.4 GHz at 4.5 dBi and 5 GHz at 5 dBi\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC antenna is connected to a dedicated software-defined radio for spectrum analysis and other advanced RF features. The RF\\\\nASIC antenna is of the same design as the serving radio antennas to provide a similar view of the network as the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe newer antenna design on the Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series is an improvement over the older Aironet 4800i, as the micro-cell antenna\\\\ncoverage has been improved to allow for a new concept called a “meso” cell. A meso cell is a hybrid between a macro and a micro cell. This\\\\nhardware innovation may lead to improved coverage in the micro cell with newer software releases.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of antenna coverage in the Cisco Catalyst 9130I and Aironet 4800 Series\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I antenna patterns, dual-band 5 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I antenna patterns, single-band 5 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I antenna patterns, dual-band 2.4 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 24.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I antenna patterns, RF ASIC (AUX dual band)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9130I antenna patterns, BLE and IoT\\\\n\\\\n## Cisco Catalyst 9130E (external antenna model)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.**\\\\n\\\\n9130E showing antenna connector\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9130E requires the use of an external antenna system.

Customers who have existing antennas can connect them to the 9130E via a DART-8\\\\n(smart adapter cable).\\\\n\\\\n## Legacy antenna support\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9130E is designed for use with SIAs that are terminated with a smart antenna connector (DART-8). The use of a DART\\\\nadapter cable will put the AP into legacy antenna mode. Depending upon the adapter being used, antennas up to 6 dBi (with RP-TNC) or\\\\nup to 13 dBi (with “N”-style connectors) may be used.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco AIR-CAB-003-D8-N= for conventional antennas up to 13 dBi with “N”-style connectors\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nwith the 9130E, so there is no P model for the 9130E.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 4-port DART adapter used with the Cisco Catalyst 9120AXE, Cisco part number AIR-CAB-002-DART-R=, is not compatible\\\\nwith the newer Cisco Catalyst 9130E Access Point.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding the Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series tri-radio support\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nDefault mode on the 9130 Series\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series can run 5 GHz in 8x8 or dual 5-GHz 4x4 mode.\\\\n\\\\nThe default mode on the 9130 Series is 5-GHz 8x8 and 2.4-GHz 4x4 mode. This default mode provides the highest throughput per single\\\\nradio, with performance gains mainly in MU-MIMO client environments. This mode provides a better data rate but less range, with more\\\\nreceivers hearing the client for better Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nDual 5-GHz 4x4 mode\\\\n\\\\nThere are instances when it becomes beneficial to change the operation of the 5-GHz radio from 8x8 into two independent 5-GHz 4x4\\\\nradios. The benefit with dual 5-GHz 4x4 radios is that it allows for macro-micro cell operation, which is very useful in high-density\\\\nenvironments. It also permits more clients for greater performance when there are fewer Wi-Fi 6-capable clients or when the need arises to\\\\ncreate two different 5-GHz Wi-Fi coverage cells or change operational modes such as monitoring.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** Example of Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series operational modes and criteria\\\\n\\\\n5 GHz Radio Role Drivers\\\\n\\\\nRadio 1 Radio 2\\\\n\\\\n**8x8 Client serving** None Preferred Operation in 160MHz or 80+80MHz\\\\nHigher MU-MIMO Stations\\\\nLower Channel reuse requirement\\\\nRequired Higher Number of Spatial Streams (SS)\\\\n\\\\n**4x4 Client serving** 4x4 Client serving High Client Density and Capacity requirements\\\\nDirectional Antenna Units (Coverage Slicing)\\\\nOperation as 80MHz or below\\\\n\\\\n**4x4 Client serving** Monitor Lower MU-MIMO Stations\\\\nLow density, better channel reuse\\\\nMonitoring Application Requires 4x4 RX\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring the Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series tri-radio\\\\n\\\\nOn initialization (by default) the 9130 Series will be in 2.4-GHz 4x4 and 1x 5-GHz 8x8 mode. Note that at the radio interface configuration\\\\nlevel, dual radio mode is Auto (disabled). “Auto” indicates that the radio may be assigned by Flexible Radio Assignment (FRA), and\\\\n“disabled” indicates that it has either been assigned as an 8x8 mode or has not yet been evaluated by FRA. If FRA assigned dual 5-GHz\\\\nmode, “disabled” will become “enabled.” Either way, “Auto” indicates that the radio is in FRA mode and has not been overridden manually.\\\\nAll eight antennas will be assigned to this single interface.\\\\n\\\\nAlso note that in the interface list, slots 1 and 2 for the same AP are both listed; however, slot 2 is grayed out because it is already active as\\\\npart of slot 1’s 8x8 mode and thus is not addressable as slot 2. To enable dual-band mode, select Dual Radio Mode –> Enabled. This will\\\\nmanually split the 8x8 into two functioning, independent 4x4 radios.\\\\n\\\\nThe radio in slot 1 switches to using only four antennas. The slot 2 radio becomes active and also has four antenna chains. Each 4x4 radio\\\\nis now an independent interface and can be assigned a different channel and will serve two different groups of users.\\\\n**Note:** Once the Admin status of the secondary radio is enabled, to disable dual radio mode, you must first disable the Admin status of the\\\\nsecondary radio. Otherwise, this warning will appear.\\\\n\\\\n|5 GHz Radio Role|Col2|Drivers|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|Radio 1|Radio 2||\\\\n|8x8 Client serving None Preferred Operation in 160MHz or 80+80MHz Higher MU-MIMO Stations Lower Channel reuse requirement Required Higher Number of Spatial Streams (SS) 4x4 Client serving 4x4 Client serving High Client Density and Capacity requirements Directional Antenna Units (Coverage Slicing) Operation as 80MHz or below 4x4 Client serving Monitor Lower MU-MIMO Stations Low density, better channel reuse Monitoring Application Requires 4x4 RX|||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSlot 1 and slot 2 are enabled, and slot 2 has independent configurations as well as four of the eight available antennas assigned to it.\\\\n\\\\nConfiguring for FRA is the same for the tri-radio as it is for other Cisco FRA-capable APs. The FRA role must be selected. “Auto” leaves it\\\\nup to FRA, and “Client Serving” means it will serve clients and beacon as an active interface. “Monitor” means that it will simply scan all of\\\\nthe channels in the 5-GHz band.\\\\n\\\\nRole selection is available for both interfaces or just one, depending on the configuration of dual radio mode. When dual radio mode is\\\\nenabled, both interfaces are assignable by FRA and both have independent role selection. In Auto mode, the available choices for FRA will\\\\nbe between Client Serving and Monitor and will be assigned by FRA based on the number of active 5-GHz interfaces that are available and\\\\nthe availability of noninterfering channels for assignment to the first and second 5-GHz interface.\\\\n\\\\nIt is possible that, under FRA’s control, no 5-GHz interfaces will be assigned to Client Serving. This would occur if RRM’s Dynamic Channel\\\\nAssignment (DCA) doesn’t have an available noninterfering channel to assign, and would generally be because of channel exhaustion (too\\\\nmany 5-GHz interfaces too close together), based on over-the-air measurements. To free more channels, check on the channel bandwidth\\\\nyou are assigning. An 80-MHz channel bandwidth will consume four channels per interface and, in dual 5-GHz mode, will require eight\\\\nchannels for a single AP. Reconfiguring the channel to 40 MHz will free four channels per dual 5-GHz AP and allow a lot more interfaces to\\\\nbe active without interference.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding self-identifying antennas\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nSelf-identifying antennas\\\\n\\\\nWith the release of the 9130E, we are introducing three new antennas with the smart antenna connector. These antennas sport a new\\\\nindustrial design that is designed to complement the access point.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** These three antennas fully support 5 GHz in 8x8 mode and 2.4 GHz in 4x4 mode as well as BLE/IoT and RF ASIC functionality, but\\\\nthey do not support dual 5 GHz due to the antennas’ smaller sizes. Higher-gain antennas with additional features and modes such as dual 5\\\\nGHz are planned.\\\\n\\\\nC-ANT9101= Ceiling mount omnidirectional, similar to AIR-ANT2524V4C-R=\\\\n\\\\nC-ANT9102= Wall/pole mount omnidirectional, similar to AIR-ANT2544V4M-R=\\\\n\\\\nC-ANT9103= Wall/pole mount patch, similar to AIR-ANT2566D4M-R=\\\\n\\\\nThe above antennas have a single insertion cable, and each antenna contains SIA circuitry to automate provisioning and detection. In\\\\naddition, each antenna contains an indicator light (LED) that mimics the light on the access point, allowing the antenna to have an “active”\\\\nstatus.\\\\n\\\\nFor installations where a longer cable length between the C9130AXE and one of the above antennas is needed, a 3-foot extension cable is\\\\navailable (AIR-CAB003-D8-D8=). Note that use of the extension cable will increase the RF signal loss in both Tx and Rx directions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nC-ANT9101= Ceiling-mount omnidirectional antenna\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco C-ANT9101 ceiling-mount omnidirectional antenna allows for installations in the center of the tile and has a lower profile than the\\\\naccess point mounted on the ceiling rail (pictured above next to the antenna on the right).

Each connector is labeled.\\\\n\\\\nIn dual 5-GHz mode, ports A through D are 2.4 and 5 GHz (4x4 mode), and ports E through H are a secondary 5-GHz radio.\\\\n\\\\nDirectional antennas can then be used, sending 2.4 or 5 GHz in one direction and the secondary 5 GHz in a totally different direction.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 57.**\\\\n\\\\nUsing directional antennas with the DART adapter\\\\n\\\\nThis external antenna flexibility allows for any combination of micro and macro cells, as well as coverage in different cell areas if desired\\\\n(indoor/outdoor), such as a hospital room with one set of radios and the hallway with the other. True RF flexibility is possible using the\\\\nDART cable adapter.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important, however, to separate the discrete 4x4 antennas away from each other so they do not cause degradation. It helps to use\\\\ndirectional antennas or, if using omnidirectional antennas, to have proper spacing (minimum of 2 meters). Below are some general thoughts\\\\nregarding isolation.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 58.**\\\\n\\\\nCreating RF isolation\\\\n\\\\nMount antennas away from each other whenever possible, and follow the isolation guidelines in the section below on FRA and dual 5-GHz\\\\noperations.\\\\n\\\\n|DART adapter and RF connections|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Dart Label|RF Connection|\\\\n|A 2.4 / 5 GHz (Dual-Band) B 2.4 / 5 GHz (Dual-Band) C 2.4 / 5 GHz (Dual-Band) D 2.4 / 5 GHz (Dual-Band) E 5 GHz F 5 GHz G 5 GHz H 5 GHz||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series Access Points have a Flexible Radio Assignment (FRA) feature. The AP is a tri-band radio, as it contains a\\\\ndedicated flexible 8x8 5-GHz radio that can, if desired, be split into two separate 4x4 radios (allowing the access point to support two\\\\ndifferent 5-GHz 4x4 radios that can be configured independently to serve clients).\\\\n\\\\nUnlike previous Cisco products that disabled the 2.4-GHz radio when going into dual 5-GHz mode, the 9130 Series access points have a\\\\ndedicated 2.4-GHz radio that is also active (regardless of the 5-GHz state) and shares the primary four dual-band antennas (ports A\\\\nthrough D) with the 5-GHz radio, so 2.4-GHz 4x4 operation can function simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nWhen operating in dual 5-GHz mode, the primary antenna ports A through D operate in dual-band mode, supporting both 2.4 GHz and 5\\\\nGHz simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nManaging dual 5-GHz cells is one of the most important things that FRA does. There are two modes of operation for dual 5-GHz APs:\\\\n\\\\n  - Macro/micro: A large cell with a smaller internal cell, creating double the capacity within the boundaries of a single cell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Macro/macro: Dual independent 5-GHz cells, doubling the coverage of a single traditional dual-band AP. Macro/macro mode is\\\\n\\\\nsupported only on the 9120AXE and 9130E (as external antennas are used to accomplish this).\\\\n\\\\nMacro/micro mode is a use case applicable to the Cisco Catalyst 9130I model, as the internal antennas are designed to support a cellwithin-a-cell deployment. For this to be effective, much design is committed to isolating the two cells, starting at the silicon and ending with\\\\nseparation in antenna polarity and frequency separation.\\\\n\\\\nFRA and DCA will enforce many configuration requirements when operating as dual 5-GHz macro/micro:\\\\n\\\\n  - Minimum 100-MHz channel separation (frequency diversity)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Micro-cell power is restricted to minimum\\\\n\\\\n  - Same Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) on each cell\\\\n\\\\nHaving a macro/micro cell architecture is attractive because it solves the problem of having one large cell in which a very diverse client\\\\nexperience exists. Clients closer to the AP are using higher data rates and enjoy a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than will clients at the\\\\nedge of the cell. Macro/micro mode allows isolation of different clients within the cell that can serve them best and preserves airtime by\\\\nincreasing overall efficiency.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 59.**\\\\n\\\\nMacro and micro cells\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: A dual 5-GHz-capable Cisco Catalyst 9130I creating micro and macro cells can perform much as two independent 5-GHz**\\\\naccess points would, using all the features and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the 9130I is operating in dual 5-GHz mode, clients get equal airtime, lower channel utilization rates, faster client-connected data\\\\nrates, and fewer retries.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 60.**\\\\n\\\\nSingle 5-GHz channel and dual 5-GHz channels\\\\n\\\\nLeft: Single-channel model – utilization is at 60 percent on channel 36\\\\nRight: Dual-channel model – channel 36 drops to 20 percent and channel 108 is at 24 percent\\\\nIn the figure above, on the left a single channel cell, channel 36, has a channel utilization of 60 percent because all clients are connected to\\\\nthat one channel. To make matters worse, they connect at nonuniform speeds, as the close-in clients connect much faster than the faraway clients.\\\\nIn the dual-channel model on the right, the improvements achieved by using two channels become clear. This results in far less contention\\\\nand fewer retries and a far better user experience.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** This feature was first introduced in the Aironet 2800 and 3800 Series, which won Cisco’s Pioneer Award for innovation in\\\\nengineering design in 2017. This mode has a very big advantage for reducing channel utilization when combined with Wi-Fi 6 features\\\\nthat help with latency and small packets.\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: Using dual 5 GHz, users experience faster throughput, fewer retries, and a better Wi-Fi experience due to faster data rates**\\\\nand less channel utilization.\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir spectrum analysis using Cisco’s RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco CleanAir technology is a custom hardware and software solution.\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome the visibility limitations inherent to standard Wi-Fi chipsets, Cisco has created an integrated solution with patented chips and\\\\nsoftware that has been specifically designed to analyze and classify all RF activity. (More than 25 patents have been issued for this\\\\ntechnology to date.)\\\\nEssentially, Cisco has taken the technology behind the Cisco Spectrum Expert analysis tool and integrated it directly into the infrastructure,\\\\nincluding deep integration with a dedicated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and a custom RF ASIC. This is a significant development and\\\\nclearly demonstrates that wireless has transitioned from nice-to-have to business-critical in the enterprise.\\\\nThe custom solution starts with the Cisco SAgE hardware core, which has been integrated directly into the Cisco RF ASIC custom silicon.\\\\nThe SAgE core handles very compute-intensive operations, such as high-resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pulse detection\\\\noperations. (A pulse is a burst of RF energy in frequency and time.) The SAgE core has a highly granular spectral resolution of 78.125 kHz\\\\n(4 times better than the nearest competitive solution and 64 times better than most chipsets).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSAgE core handles a base level of spectrum analysis operations that are so processing intensive that they can be prohibitive to handle in\\\\nreal-time software or by the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: Comprehensive RF analysis and insight into the spectrum that no other competitor has, clearly identifying interference on a\\\\ndedicated SDR (separate from the client-serving radios) so as to not impact access point client-serving performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 61.**\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir clearly identifies the interference, using a dedicated radio and custom silicon\\\\n\\\\n## Dual DFS – RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC and CleanAir chipset augment the determination of DFS signals, enhancing DFS and reducing DFS false alerts so the AP can\\\\nstay on a DFS channel more robustly. In addition, the dedicated radio participates in Cisco’s RRM for interference mitigation and best\\\\nchannel selection.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 62.**\\\\n\\\\nA DFS event (detected by Wi-Fi chipset) is compared to the RF ASIC to verify that it is indeed a real DFS event\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC is far more advanced than the DFS detection used by the Wi-Fi chipset and serves as a “second set of eyes” into the\\\\nspectrum. The RF ASIC as a dedicated SDR will be enhanced further with new features as future software upgrades are released.\\\\n\\\\n## FastLocate – RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) FastLocate technology enables quick location refresh for connected Wi-Fi clients. The\\\\nReceived Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from data packets and probe frames, when available, is used for calculating a location. This\\\\ntechnology is available with both centrally switched WLANs and Cisco FlexConnect[®] (locally switched WLANs).\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: The Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series, with its onboard RF ASIC monitoring radio, enhances location by allowing access points on\\\\ndifferent client-serving channels to use the RF ASIC to listen to the probes and data packets on the Wi-Fi client of interest, regardless of its\\\\nchannel.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 63.**\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC radio can track Wi-Fi clients regardless of the serving channel\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing, warehouses, and factories\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of the material being warehoused. When\\\\nperforming a coverage check (site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels, as the material being warehoused can change\\\\nthe RF coverage, creating loss of uniform coverage. Also, try to position the APs as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the\\\\nantennas when possible. If the AP is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, in the best case. When configuring\\\\ncoverage for aisles, try to use directional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain omnidirectional antennas\\\\non the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units with integrated antennas, as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to have more nulls.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the AP lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 64.**\\\\n\\\\nAP placement in a warehouse environment\\\\n\\\\n(An external dipole “e” series or internal antenna “i” series version could be used.)\\\\nWhen mounting an AP at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to\\\\nthe holes of most electrical boxes. Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 65.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting an AP onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare/clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nIf the Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series is used in a clean room, hospital, or other area where the need for infection control requires the access\\\\npoint to be wiped down with a chemical, it is recommended that a ready-to-use sterilant such as Steris Spor-Klenz be used. Unlike some\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nSteris Spor Klenz: https://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface disinfectants/sporicide cleaners and sterilant/spor klenz ready to us\\\\ne-cold-sterilant\\\\n\\\\nIf the healthcare environment has metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 66.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon metal enclosure protects and secures the AP in clean room areas\\\\n\\\\nStadiums and harsh environments\\\\n\\\\nCustomers wishing to install the AP in harsh environments where it may be exposed to weather, such as sporting areas, stadiums, open\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA enclosure. This varies around the world. For example,\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit AP outdoor NEMA enclosures if the AP is indoors, such as in a freezer or garden area, but may prohibit its\\\\nuse outdoors. This seems to vary with weather radar compliance in different countries and often with UNII-1 compliance. Check with your\\\\nCisco account team or the communications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 67.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of an AccelTex 12x10x6 NEMA enclosure\\\\n\\\\nThird-party sources for NEMA type enclosures and other accessories include:\\\\n\\\\n[Oberon](http://www.oberonwireless.com)\\\\n\\\\n[AccelTex](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[Ventev TerraWave](http://www.terra-wave.com)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-type enclosure, try to have the cables exit out of the bottom of the enclosure so that rain and moisture do not run\\\\ndown the cable into the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating. For example, a black enclosure gets much\\\\nhotter in the sun than a white one. You may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nEducation/schools\\\\n\\\\nSee the deployment guide at the following URL:\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/schoolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/schoolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing APs near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route electrical or Ethernet wiring in the near field (6 to 15 inches) of the antenna. Try to\\\\nrefrain from installing the AP in the electrical closet, as the best place for it is as close to the users as possible or practical. If you must\\\\nremote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire/safety regulations for more on\\\\nthis).\\\\n\\\\nBelow are a few URLs for understanding interference:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Sol\\\\nutions_White_Paper.html\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing APs in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is\\\\nimportant to check the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is\\\\nonly a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging, since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of APs\\\\nrather quickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna\\\\n(or the actual AP) on the bottom of the elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing any Wi-Fi equipment inside elevator cars or shafts, local regulations need to be followed, as many times such installations\\\\nare prohibited either for safety reasons or because the building owner or local fire department may prohibit them. Also, it is dangerous, and\\\\nonly elevator repair persons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas. When external antennas are\\\\nrequired, again position and use the 9130E model.\\\\n\\\\n## WLAN best practices\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 68.**\\\\n\\\\nCoverage is optimized for ceiling placement and radiates omnidirectionally\\\\n\\\\nGeneral design guidelines: Access point spacing recommendations\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a Wi-Fi device such as an AP, and you are going to use another AP in the vicinity on a different channel, it is recommended that\\\\nyou space the APs approximately 6 feet (2 meters) apart. Avoid clustering the APs or the antennas from different APs together, as this\\\\ncould cause degradation in performance. This recommended distance is based on the assumption that both devices operate in the\\\\nunlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB – that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space them farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges, for example, frequency-hopping\\\\nlegacy APs or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the AP (think below or above the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands), you\\\\nshould consider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference\\\\nby testing both devices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much,\\\\nif any, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\nWarning\\\\n\\\\nIn order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located a minimum of 7.9 inches (20 centimeters)\\\\nor more from the body of all persons. See the installation guide under “Declaration of Conformity” for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nMixing access points of different models and types\\\\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series are very advanced access points supporting Wi-Fi 6 features along with unique features such as dual 5\\\\nGHz and advanced RF detection using Cisco custom RF ASIC silicon.\\\\nFor this reason, it is not recommended that you mix access point models, sometimes referred to as a “salt and pepper” approach, as the\\\\n9130 Series can make spectrum decisions, such as dual DFS detection, that other access points do not partake in.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, if you have a mixture of AP types, it is recommended that you group like access points together (for example, Aironet 3800\\\\nSeries on one floor and Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series on another) and refrain from mixing them.\\\\n\\\\n## General placement guidelines\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding access point installations.\\\\n\\\\n  - Always try to mount the AP as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment (for example,\\\\n\\\\nhospitals have metal doors, coverage can change when the doors close, and old buildings can have metal gridwork in the plaster or\\\\nasbestos). Avoid mounting the AP or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area, affecting clients.\\\\n\\\\n  - When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1-, 6-, and 11-channel scheme is used as in the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting\\\\n\\\\nall of the APs on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco RRM, FRA, and other features can help automate the process.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Try to determine which clients are heavily used, checking the coverage with those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might\\\\n\\\\nnot have the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip\\\\n\\\\nVerify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n - While site surveys are highly recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco RRM is in place, sometimes a limited site\\\\n\\\\nsurvey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. If this is a very challenging environment, such as train connectivity, oil or\\\\ngas sites, or large hospitals, Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform\\\\nyour installation. See your Cisco account team for more information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 69.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of a channel coverage model spacing nonoverlapping channels\\\\n\\\\n## Antenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical or possible, keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low-Loss (LL)\\\\nand Ultra-Low-Loss (ULL) cables, which have the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nCisco cables carry the part number AIR-CAB and then a length. For example, a 20-foot length of LL cable with RP-TNC connector is Cisco\\\\nAIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing areas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 70.**\\\\n\\\\nA Cisco cable with RP-TNC connector\\\\n\\\\nWhen drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically a 5/8-inch drill bit if RP-TNC, above). Other connectors such as\\\\n“N” style and DART are larger in size.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ny y y\\\\n\\\\n- Before refreshing to Wi-Fi 6, it’s time to do a review of your existing WLAN issues as well as identifying any new location, BLE, or IoT\\\\n\\\\nrequirements.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- One-to-one replacement assumes that the AP was installed in the best place to meet your current coverage and density goals.\\\\n\\\\n- Do you have any coverage issues today that you have not addressed?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Are there any poorly mounted or suboptimal installations?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Ideally, you should have at least 802.3at (30W PoE) available.\\\\n\\\\n  - Wi-Fi 6 might help mitigate a poor design, but nothing beats installing it right the first time.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many tools out there to model and perform site surveys. Cisco has recently worked with Ekahau to import Cisco APs and\\\\nantenna models into their application, which also includes the ability to model BLE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 71.**\\\\n\\\\nEkahau offers a site survey and WLAN planner software\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing an active survey for placement, it is always best to have the equipment you plan to deploy. Having the actual model that is\\\\nbeing planned for is not always possible at the time the planning is being done. Cisco spends a great deal of effort to ensure that newermodel APs’ RF coverage matches closely with previous AP models to reduce the cost of planning and replacing APs. The Cisco Catalyst\\\\n9130 Series is no different. The figure below shows the Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Series as compared with the Aironet 3802i on the same\\\\nchannel and power, as an example only. Surveying using an alternate AP is suitable for Bill Of Materials (BOM) generation or updates to an\\\\nexisting installation. Critical coverage should always be measured using the same model to be certain of the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 72.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of Cisco Catalyst 9120AX Series and Aironet 3802i coverage patterns as measured over the air\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The cell sizes in the figure above also apply to the Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series, as it has similar cell sizes.\\\\n\\\\nIf the building is not wired for Ethernet and you need to power a Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series Access Point from a battery, AccelTex offers a\\\\nbattery pack that can be used.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 73.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex site survey battery pack P/N ATS-SSBP-1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nUseful URLs:\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco CleanAir white paper: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/cleanair-technology/white_paper_c\\\\n\\\\n11-599260.html\\\\n\\\\n  - Flexible Radio Assignment and dual 5-GHz operation: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/b_RRM\\\\n\\\\n_White_Paper/b_RRM_White_Paper_chapter_01000.html\\\\n\\\\n  - Flexible radio Cisco Aironet 2800/3800 Series deployment guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/\\\\n\\\\n8-3/b_cisco_aironet_series_2800_3800_access_point_deployment_guide.pdf\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Multigigabit overview, along with supported switches: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/catalyst-multi\\\\n\\\\ngigabit-switching/index.html\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco DNA overview: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/cisco-digital-network-architecture/sol\\\\n\\\\nution-overview-c22-736580.pdf\\\\n\\\\n### Our experts recommend\\\\n\\\\nApplication Hosting on Catalyst Access Points White Paper\\\\n\\\\nApplication Hosting on Catalyst Access Points At-a-Glance\\\\n\\\\nCisco Catalyst 9100 and Wi-Fi 6/6E (802.11ax) FAQ\\\\n\\\\n### Learn more\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n\",\"fileMetadata\":{\"format\":\"PDF 1.4\",\"title\":\"Cisco Catalyst 9130 Series Access Point Deployment Guide - Cisco\",\"author\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"creator\":\"wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6\",\"producer\":\"Qt 4.8.7\",\"creationDate\":\"D:20240222171531+05\\'30\\'\",\"modDate\":\"\",\"trapped\":\"\",\"encryption\":null},\"candidateCollections\":[{\"uuid\":\"0e21aaad-4f3d-43ec-b7bc-57fe4c84bb2e\",\"description\":\"Company descriptions including their basic parameters such as their size, location, activities and industry.

The Cisco 819 ISR gateway provides a rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and\\\\nsecure solution designed specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications\\\\ninclude industrial automation, transportation, financial, health care, utility, and retail. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the\\\\nCisco 819 family delivers, enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary\\\\nand mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. Figure 1 shows a Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR is available in both non-hardened (Cisco 819G) and hardened (Cisco 819HG) versions. Both models include\\\\nsupport for 3G up to 3.7G wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 3G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and\\\\nsecure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the\\\\nfootprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where\\\\nspace, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical\\\\nfactors.\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide\\\\ngeographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports enterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco\\\\n819HGW platforms concurrently support both 3G for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual radio WLAN on the same platform as\\\\nshown in Figure 2. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s\\\\nCleanAir technology, to create a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated\\\\nAP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices\\\\nand dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Figure 2 shows the 819 ISR with integrated 3G and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP.

Business customers are using broadband access to connect to the Internet or to connect offices together,\\\\nand they require a platform that incorporates voice and security without sacrificing performance. The Cisco 881V and Cisco\\\\n887VA-V voice routers offer industry-leading voice gateway capability with the ability enable Cisco Unified Communications\\\\nManager Express or SRST as required. Many of these customers are connecting computers in offices through WLANs; having a\\\\nsingle device for both WAN and WLAN access provides a new option for managed services. These customers also require a\\\\nhigher level of support to keep their networks operational. Services with these customers should be simple to set up, while\\\\nallowing a level of remote management and troubleshooting to address support inquiries quickly. The Cisco 880 Series meets the\\\\nrequirements of small offices and managed services providers.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2 shows deployment scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Deployment Scenarios\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880 Series is ideally suited for deployment in a small office or in a small office that is part of a large network, most\\\\noften with a secure VPN connection. These types of offices can include the following:\\\\n\\\\n  - Small remote office: The Cisco 880 Series can connect users in a small remote office, such as an insurance, lawyer, or\\\\n\\\\nsales office. When connecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security such as firewall and intrusion\\\\nprevention protect the network at the perimeter. The Cisco 880 with the Cisco Unified Border Element Series can also\\\\nsupport connection to SIP trunking Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services the service provider offers. Additionally, IT managers can\\\\ncentrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot any network problems. For added reliability, customers can also\\\\nuse the integrated 3G or ISDN backup or connect through an external modem if the primary broadband link fails. Integrated\\\\nsecure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management devices at the remote site. Redundant WAN\\\\nlinks offer business continuity, enabling nondisruptive business operation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Virtual office: The Cisco 880 Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers who have a mix of broadband connection types such\\\\n\\\\nas DSL, 3G, and Metro Ethernet. The Cisco 880 Voice Gateway and SRST Series provides a secure virtual office with all\\\\nthe collaborative services such as data, voice, and fax services. SRST helps ensure voice services are operational in case\\\\nof WAN link failure, and redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow\\\\nfor connection of an IP or analog phone to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated\\\\nWLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series helps ensure that if wireless connectivity is used it is secure. (Refer to the Cisco\\\\n[Virtual Office Solution, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo, for more information.)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\n- Remote call-center agent: Similar to teleworking applications, this solution extends the Cisco IP Contact Center solution for\\\\n\\\\ntelephone call-center agents to remote sites. With a high-quality, secure connection through the Cisco 880 Series, callcenter agents can be dispersed away from costly call-center facilities while maintaining secure and productive voice and\\\\ndata access in their homes. SRST and business-continuity solutions in the Cisco 880 Series provide reliability and\\\\ncontinuous business operation. Alternatively, the remote call-center agent can be provided with SIP trunking service with\\\\n\\\\ni d ti id d b Ci U ifi d B d El t f t d th t l ll t f d ll t th\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng q y p y y y ( )\\\\n\\\\nother data security requirements. They can then add multiple devices and applications to the store network to take\\\\nadvantage of the increased bandwidth and also incorporate optional WLAN support to enable secure mobility and enhance\\\\nproductivity.\\\\n\\\\n  - Managed services: Service providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 880 Series as a platform to offer\\\\n\\\\ndifferentiated business-class security, voice, and WLAN services for small business customers. With built-in analog and\\\\ndigital voice ports and the ability to upgrade to a five-user Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express IP PBX, service\\\\nproviders can now offer all the Cisco Unified Communications benefits to small and medium-sized businesses.

The Cisco 819 ISR gateway provides a rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and secure solution designed specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications include industrial automation, transportation, financial, health care, utility, and retail. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the Cisco 819 family delivers, enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. Figure 1 shows a Cisco 819HG Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n#### The Cisco 819 ISR is available in both non-hardened (Cisco 819G) and hardened (Cisco 819HG) versions. (Figures 2 and 3, respectively). Both models include support for 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 4G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the ISR M2M Gateway footprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where space, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical factors.\\\\n\\\\n For mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide geographic areas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Nonhardened Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.** Hardened Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### A critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 ISR serves as the single, horizontal platform which enhances the Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere, any place” across multiple industries, including banking, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco architecture.\\\\n\\\\n Product Overview\\\\n\\\\n The Cisco 819 Integrated Services Routers support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 LTE standards for 4G LTE. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The Cisco 819 Routers have the following variants:\\\\n\\\\n  - C819HG-4G-V-K9 and C819G-4G-V-K9: Dedicated multimode LTE for Verizon Wireless networks (700MHz band 13); the\\\\n\\\\n#### multimode C819 is backward-compatible with code division multiple access (CDMA) 1x/ EV-DO Rev A: 800 and 1900 MHz\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- C819HG-4G-A-K9 and C819G-4G-A-K9: Multimode LTE for AT&T (700MHz band 17); multimode C819 is backward\\\\n#### compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), high-speed packet access plus (HSPA+): 850, 1900, and 2100 MHz\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - C819HG-4G-G-K9 and C819G-4G-G-K9: Multimode LTE for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band\\\\n\\\\n#### 8), 1800 MHz (band3), 2100 MHz (band 1), or 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; the multimode C819 is backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 900 and 2100 MHz\\\\n\\\\n The Cisco 819 ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no\\\\n\\\\n#### additional hardware or client software, This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, banks, and mobile fleets, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco WAN optimization system consists of WAAS Express (WE) routers and Wide-area Application Engines (WAEs) that\\\\n\\\\n#### work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\n#### switch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\n#### management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\n#### traditional wireline services. The 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 4G LTE WWAN Cisco 819 offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n Business Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\n Businesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer.

With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area Application Engines (WAEs) that work\\\\n\\\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic\\\\nand acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmanagers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to\\\\n\\\\nsupplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100\\\\nMbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data\\\\nservices can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on\\\\nthese performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN: This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Name) APN so that Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate**\\\\n\\\\ntraffic. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the bearer is part of show**\\\\n\\\\nCLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this service. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP**\\\\n\\\\nspec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at the service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP)\\\\ndependent, and requires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can be integrated with Cisco Unified**\\\\n\\\\nCommunications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster\\\\nand has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours,\\\\nwithout worrying about availability of broadband services and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be\\\\ncustomized to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and\\\\nresiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable businesses to stay productive during service\\\\nprovider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different wireless networks is\\\\ntransparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the\\\\nuser’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile\\\\nnetwork or subnet to stay connected. The dual radio WLAN on the 819 can serve as both a client and an access-point.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs for low-cost broadband\\\\naccess, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to\\\\nthe store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security and wireless LAN\\\\n(WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\\\\nsupport for 3G MIB with 4G LTE MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Table 1.

Mobile operators realize the importance of\\\\n\\\\nretaining their existing voice-service customers in the emerging all-IP world.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, mobile networks have been evolving over the last few years from second-generation (2G) to\\\\n\\\\nthird-generation (3G) and now to all-IP networks such as Long-Term Evolution LTE and wireless networks. This\\\\n\\\\nchallenges mobile operators to transition their mobile services infrastructure from a circuit-based to an all-IP\\\\n\\\\narchitecture, capable of preserving existing voice and Short Message Service (SMS) revenues and delivering\\\\n\\\\nenhanced services that take advantage of the higher speed and lower latency of LTE networks.\\\\n\\\\nThis requires a convergence vision that uses the existing 2G and 3G services infrastructure as a part of the\\\\n\\\\nconverged services core based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and that opens services capabilities toward the\\\\n\\\\nweb services domain and mobile application ecosystems. Operators can derive great value by employing cross\\\\ndomain capabilities to support new IP-based services that transparently coexist with traditional voice and\\\\n\\\\nmessaging services.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco[®] Converged Services Platform (CSP) allows operators to deploy enhanced voice, video, and\\\\n\\\\nmessaging services across any generation of mobile devices and broadband access networks. Cisco CSP\\\\n\\\\nsupports a wide range of applications and functionalities to deliver services over 2G, 3G, Wi-Fi and LTE networks\\\\n\\\\n– such as Voice and Video over LTE (V[2]oLTE), Rich Communication Suite (RCS) and Converged Messaging – all\\\\n\\\\nfrom a single platform. Cisco CSP offers solutions for the mobile operators that:\\\\n\\\\n  - Provide real-time communication services for mobile user communities: voice, video, multimedia, and\\\\n\\\\nsocial messaging for revenue generation\\\\n\\\\n  - Provide network optimization: social network aggregation, voice and message routing and media delivery\\\\n\\\\nover IP for cost reduction\\\\n\\\\n  - Provide open network interfaces to support third-party application development for new business models\\\\n\\\\nMobile operators can deploy the services they want, when they want to deploy them, on the Cisco Converged\\\\n\\\\nServices Platform.\\\\n\\\\n## Platform for Convergence\\\\n\\\\nCisco CSP applications are based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and HTTP, and comply with 3rd Generation\\\\n\\\\nPartnership Project (3GPP), 3GPP2, IETF, and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specifications such as Multimedia\\\\n\\\\nTelephony (MMTel), OMA SIMPLE Presence and instant messaging, and OMA Converged IP Messaging (CPM).\\\\n\\\\nThe platform supports industry-standard interfaces to connect with existing mobile access networks; mobile core\\\\n\\\\nnetworks; SIP, voice over IP (VoIP), and IMS core networks; web services through representational state transfer\\\\n\\\\n(REST); and broadband IP access networks including LTE over open-standard interfaces.\\\\n\\\\nAs shown in Figure 1, Cisco CSP is packaged with a software framework that supports rapid service development\\\\n\\\\nand delivery across multiple network domains–circuit, SIP, and web. The platform consists of an application layer\\\\n\\\\nwith functional modules, providing the service logic to deliver services in the network. This layer uses a services\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nand subscriber profile layer, which includes sophisticated routing and carrier-grade capabilities to deliver\\\\n\\\\npersonalized services with flexible deployment options that include geographic redundancy. These functions\\\\n\\\\nconnect to a common interface abstraction layer, providing the flexibility to link any application service logic or\\\\n\\\\nfunction to any element in the network to provide convergence across service domains. This modular and layered\\\\n\\\\nsoftware architecture allows Cisco to deliver blended services across access domains and core networks.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco Converged Services Platform Software Architecture\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile operators, Cisco CSP delivers:\\\\n\\\\n  - Rapid IP-based service delivery across 2G, 3G, Wi-Fi and LTE domains and devices\\\\n\\\\n  - Voice, video, and messaging services deployed on a single platform, reducing operational expenses\\\\n\\\\n  - Investment protection in circuit-switch-domain equipment by using existing core network assets such as\\\\n\\\\nMobile Switching Center (MSC), Home Location Register (HLR), and SMS-C to provide convergence\\\\n\\\\nacross IMS and traditional domains.\\\\n\\\\n  - Interoperability with the Cisco ASR 5000 Series and third-party IMS core and applications servers in a\\\\n\\\\ntypical multivendor network\\\\n\\\\n  - Flexible deployment options such as separated application servers and centralized or distributed\\\\n\\\\narchitectures\\\\n\\\\n  - Fully redundant hardware, 99.999 percent reliability, and georedundant deployment options\\\\n\\\\n  - High scalability and flexibility to optimize application-specific capacity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Cisco CSP Solutions\\\\n\\\\n### Voice and Video over LTE (V[2]oLTE) \\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco V[2]oLTE solution allows LTE operators to preserve their revenues with a core voice, video, SMS and\\\\n\\\\nMultimedia Message Service (MMS) services delivery over LTE.

Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the\\\\nCisco 819 family delivers, enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary\\\\nand mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. Figure 1 shows a Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR is available in both non-hardened (Cisco 819G) and hardened (Cisco 819HG) versions. Both models include\\\\nsupport for 3G up to 3.7G wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 3G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and\\\\nsecure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the\\\\nfootprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where\\\\nspace, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical\\\\nfactors.\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide\\\\ngeographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports enterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco\\\\n819HGW platforms concurrently support both 3G for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual radio WLAN on the same platform as\\\\nshown in Figure 2. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s\\\\nCleanAir technology, to create a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated\\\\nAP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices\\\\nand dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Figure 2 shows the 819 ISR with integrated 3G and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access\\\\n[Point is available at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Non-hardened Cisco 819GW Integrated Services Router with 3G and Wi-Fi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 ISR serves as the single, horizontal platform which enhances\\\\nthe Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere, any place” across multiple industries, including banking, retail, healthcare,\\\\nmanufacturing, government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a\\\\nrelatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco architecture..\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISRs for M2M applications supports 3G High-Speed Packet Access Plus [HSPA+] and Evolution Data Optimized\\\\n\\\\n[EV-DO Rev A]), enabling up to 3.7G speeds. They are backward compatible with High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Universal\\\\nMobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service\\\\n(GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 819 3G includes an integrated WLAN access point and has two hardened and unhardened variants:\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership\\\\n\\\\nProject (3GPP), and they support HSPA+ (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access [HSUPA] and High-Speed Downlink Packet\\\\nAccess [HSDPA]), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A and Rev 0 and\\\\n\\\\n1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no\\\\n\\\\nadditional hardware or client software, This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, banks, and mobile\\\\nfleets, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies\\\\nover user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video\\\\napplications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\ntraditional wire line services. Third- and fourth-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G\\\\nand 4G LTE WWAN can be used as a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications.\\\\nThe 3G and 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband\\\\nservices are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support\\\\nfor wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\n\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch\\\\noffice or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of\\\\nbroadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that\\\\ncan be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE\\\\nwireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The\\\\nCisco 819 enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 uses standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ncommunicate with either a localized WLAN network as in a bus or train dock or communicate with a city-wide WLAN deployment\\\\nwhen in motion.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G, 3.5G or 3.7G (4G?) wireless WAN\\\\noption on the Cisco 819 for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other\\\\ndata security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security\\\\nand wireless LAN (WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities\\\\nsuch as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote\\\\nmanagement and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits of Cisco 819\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Smallest Cisco ISR in both Hardened and Non-hardened Form Factors||\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATM machines, kiosks, small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, telemetry, etc. and across all industries. ● Hardened models extend the ISR footprint into deployments wherein the router is exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, dust, splash water, shock and vibration..|\\\\n|Hardened Router Industrial- grade components|● The hardened router supports extended temperature ranges from –13 to 140ºF (–25 to 60ºC). ● Meets 95 percent of the Non-Condensing Humidity Requirements, IP 41 per IEC 60529 for Vertical Falling Water and Pollution 3 for Dust.

The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X2 MIMO built in the IR829 creates a selfhealing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated access point can serve as both an\\\\naccess point and a client to a wireless mesh network. This combined functionality provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet and cellular. The Cisco ClientLink feature of the access point improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) enables radar detection and avoidance to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. The IR829 concurrently supports both 4G LTE wireless WAN and Cisco dual-radio WLAN backhaul on the same\\\\nplatform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Dual active LTE connectivity. With two LTE modems, the IR829 enables concurrent connectivity to two**\\\\ncellular networks for high reliability, enhanced data throughputs, load balancing, and differentiated\\\\nservices. Applicable for IR829M-2LTE and IR829-2LTE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Security services, such as hardware cryptography, including Cisco’s Next Generation Encryption (https**\\\\n://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/next-generation-cryptography.html) that guarantees high\\\\nperformance for IPsec VPN traffic and firewall. Requires no additional hardware or client software. With\\\\nthese security services, fleet vehicle management and mass transit systems, for example, can intelligently\\\\nredirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web\\\\ntraffic. With this solution, businesses can deploy the market-leading web security solution quickly and\\\\neasily to protect assets from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and\\\\nresources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30**\\\\nmilliseconds or less), WWAN services provide an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services.\\\\nThe single LTE model of the IR829 supports peak data rates of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps\\\\non the uplink. The dual LTE model doubles the throughput by supporting peak data rates of 150 Mbps\\\\non the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink on each of the two cellular links. Actual data speed depends\\\\non the service provider network. With single and dual 4G LTE options, the IR829s offer a flexible,\\\\nredundant cellular connectivity for mission critical services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also\\\\nbe used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or\\\\nvery expensive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIoT gives the transportation industry an opportunity to connect people, improve safety, communicate more effectively, and\\\\nchange transportation centers into community hubs. The IR829 offers the automotive industry - including commercial fleets,\\\\nemergency-response and public safety vehicles, rail, and roadways - standards-based, scalable, and highly secure solutions.\\\\nIR829 meets FirstNet requirements, has passed certification, and supports all FirstNet features.\\\\n\\\\nFleet vehicles\\\\n\\\\nThe IR829 can withstand severe weather and environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, high vibrations, and\\\\nshocks often encountered on buses and trains. The IR829s use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS[®] Software to\\\\nhost networks in motion. Transitioning to different wireless networks is transparent to users and devices (such as laptops, smart\\\\ndevices, sensors and cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the manual intervention of users as\\\\nWAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the IR829 4G LTE routers allow an entire\\\\nmobile network or subnet to stay connected. The dual-radio 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz WLAN on the IR829 can serve as both a client\\\\nand an access-point. Our products also help transit operators effectively track vehicle fleets through built-in GPS systems.\\\\n\\\\nMass transit\\\\n\\\\nPublic-safety personnel can move critical video data and other sensitive information from incident commanders to field officers\\\\nover a secure network, giving public safety agencies and their personnel access to real-time, multimedia data in the field.

With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco WAN optimization system consists of WAAS Express (WE) routers and Wide-area Application Engines (WAEs) that\\\\n\\\\n#### work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\n#### switch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\n#### management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\n#### traditional wireline services. The 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 4G LTE WWAN Cisco 819 offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n Business Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\n Businesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n Ability to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n#### a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 allows an entire mobile network or subnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\n Retail VPN\\\\n\\\\n Retail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 4G LTE wireless WAN option on the Cisco 819 for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\n Managed Services\\\\n\\\\n Service providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security and wireless LAN (WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n Primary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n Table 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n Table 1.

The Cisco 819 ISR gateway provides a rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and\\\\nsecure solution designed specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications\\\\ninclude industrial automation, transportation, financial, health care, utility, and retail. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the\\\\nCisco 819 family delivers, enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary\\\\nand mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. Figure 1 shows a Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR is available in both non-hardened (Cisco 819G) and hardened (Cisco 819HG) versions. Both models include\\\\nsupport for 3G up to 3.7G wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 3G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and\\\\nsecure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the\\\\nfootprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where\\\\nspace, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical\\\\nfactors.\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide\\\\ngeographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports enterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco\\\\n819HGW platforms concurrently support both 3G for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual radio WLAN on the same platform as\\\\nshown in Figure 2. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s\\\\nCleanAir technology, to create a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated\\\\nAP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices\\\\nand dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Figure 2 shows the 819 ISR with integrated 3G and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP.

The Cisco 819 ISR gateway provides a rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and\\\\nsecure solution designed specifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications\\\\ninclude industrial automation, transportation, financial, health care, utility, and retail. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the\\\\nCisco 819 family delivers, enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary\\\\nand mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. Figure 1 shows a Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR is available in both non-hardened (Cisco 819G) and hardened (Cisco 819HG) versions. Both models include\\\\nsupport for 3G up to 3.7G wireless WAN (WWAN) speeds. Support for 3G offers cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and\\\\nsecure primary or backup connectivity. With support for industrial-grade components, the hardened Cisco 819HG extends the\\\\nfootprint and provides deployment flexibility. The Cisco 819HG is an ideal solution for stationary and mobile environments where\\\\nspace, heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, harsher environments, and low power consumption are critical\\\\nfactors.\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile applications, Cisco Mobile IP delivers transparent roaming across multiple wireless networks capable of covering wide\\\\ngeographic areas. Additionally, the Cisco 819 ISR supports enterprise class built-in Wireless LAN (WLAN) capability. The Cisco\\\\n819HGW platforms concurrently support both 3G for wireless WAN backhaul and Cisco dual radio WLAN on the same platform as\\\\nshown in Figure 2. The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 819, comes with Cisco’s\\\\nCleanAir technology, to create a self-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated\\\\nAP can serve both as an access point and as a client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices\\\\nand dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Figure 2 shows the 819 ISR with integrated 3G and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access\\\\n[Point is available at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Non-hardened Cisco 819GW Integrated Services Router with 3G and Wi-Fi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 ISR serves as the single, horizontal platform which enhances\\\\nthe Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere, any place” across multiple industries, including banking, retail, healthcare,\\\\nmanufacturing, government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small branch offices with a\\\\nrelatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco architecture..\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISRs for M2M applications supports 3G High-Speed Packet Access Plus [HSPA+] and Evolution Data Optimized\\\\n\\\\n[EV-DO Rev A]), enabling up to 3.7G speeds. They are backward compatible with High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Universal\\\\nMobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service\\\\n(GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 819 3G includes an integrated WLAN access point and has two hardened and unhardened variants:\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership\\\\n\\\\nProject (3GPP), and they support HSPA+ (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access [HSUPA] and High-Speed Downlink Packet\\\\nAccess [HSDPA]), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A and Rev 0 and\\\\n\\\\n1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no\\\\n\\\\nadditional hardware or client software, This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, banks, and mobile\\\\nfleets, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies\\\\nover user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. The Cisco 819 provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video\\\\napplications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\n\\\\ntraditional wire line services. Third- and fourth-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G\\\\nand 4G LTE WWAN can be used as a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications.\\\\nThe 3G and 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband\\\\nservices are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support\\\\nfor wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\n\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch\\\\noffice or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of\\\\nbroadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that\\\\ncan be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE\\\\nwireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The\\\\nCisco 819 enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 uses standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion.

This provides another source for WAN diversity along with Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and cellular. The AP ClientLink feature improves reliability\\\\nand coverage for legacy devices and dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and avoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. Cisco 819 ISR with integrated 4G LTE and 802.11 a/b/g/n AP. More information on the Cisco 3500 Access Point is available at\\\\n[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/data_sheet_c78-594630.html)\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 3 LTE standards. They provide persistent, reliable\\\\nLTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The following models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-GA-EK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 3), 2100 MHz (band 1),**\\\\n\\\\nor 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz (band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2), and 2100 MHz\\\\n(band 1).\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819GW-LTE-MNA-AK9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), 850 MHz (band 5), 700 MHz**\\\\n\\\\n(band 13), 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; or 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), with EVDO Rev A/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires no additional hardware or client\\\\n\\\\nsoftware. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for example, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular\\\\nsecurity and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch\\\\noffice users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area Application Engines (WAEs) that work\\\\n\\\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic\\\\nand acts on behalf of the client application and the destination server\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nmanagers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services are an ideal way to\\\\n\\\\nsupplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100\\\\nMbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data\\\\nservices can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on\\\\nthese performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN: This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Name) APN so that Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate**\\\\n\\\\ntraffic. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the bearer is part of show**\\\\n\\\\nCLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this service. (Available early Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP**\\\\n\\\\nspec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at the service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP)\\\\ndependent, and requires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can be integrated with Cisco Unified**\\\\n\\\\nCommunications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster\\\\nand has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours,\\\\nwithout worrying about availability of broadband services and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be\\\\ncustomized to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and\\\\nresiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable businesses to stay productive during service\\\\nprovider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition to different wireless networks is\\\\ntransparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the\\\\nuser’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile\\\\nnetwork or subnet to stay connected. The dual radio WLAN on the 819 can serve as both a client and an access-point.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs for low-cost broadband\\\\naccess, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to\\\\nthe store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security and wireless LAN\\\\n(WLAN) services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\\\\nsupport for 3G MIB with 4G LTE MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Table 1.

The specific reason for the change is due to the inability of the radio to detect the various radar pulses (DFS function) over the entire bandwidth of the channels in the 5250-5350 and the 5500-5700 A radio channel bands (which will be disabled). As a consequence the radio will now operate from 5150-5250 and 5745-5850 A radio bands. This will provide a total of nine channels in the 5GHz range.|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Multiple WAN and LAN Connections||\\\\n|Four-port 10/100-Mbps managed switch|● Allows for multiple Ethernet device connectivity in a small office or other remote location with the ability to designate a port as the network edge. ● VLANs allow for secure segmentation of network resources. ● Multiple LAN and WAN devices can be connected to standard 10/100 Ethernet or serial interfaces.|\\\\n|WAN diversity|● Multiple WAN links are supported: Gigabit Ethernet, serial, and 4G LTE provide for business continuity and WAN diversity.

With data rates\\\\napproaching T1 speeds, 3G wireless can be used for primary WAN connectivity in locations where wireline services such as DSL\\\\nand ISDN are not available or are too expensive to deploy.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Routers support the latest 3G standards (High-Speed Packet Access [HSPA] and\\\\nEV-DO Rev A) and are backward-compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), Enhanced Data Rates\\\\nfor Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 880G Series has two\\\\nvariants (refer to Table 1 for part numbers):\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on 3GPP, and they support HSPA (High\\\\nSpeed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A/Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to 3G wireless WAN, the Cisco 880G Series offers additional WAN options such as xDSL and Fast Ethernet WAN\\\\ninterface, a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed switch with VLAN support and the latest 802.11n WLAN capability. The Cisco\\\\n880 Series provides the performance required for concurrent services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, content filtering,\\\\nand encryption for VPNs; and quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications. In addition, Cisco\\\\nConfiguration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management\\\\ncapabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series 3G Wireless Integrated Services Routers\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire line services. 3G WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with\\\\ntheoretical limits in excess of 7 Mbps on the downlink and 5 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G WWAN can be use as a primary link for\\\\nsites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. The 3G WWAN data services can also be use as a costeffective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these\\\\nperformance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng p p y p y\\\\n\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow an IP phone to be\\\\nconnected to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if wireless connectivity is to be used, the connection will be secure. (Refer to Cisco Business-Ready Teleworker\\\\n[Solutions for more information, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G wireless option on the Cisco 880G\\\\nSeries for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry (PCI) and other data\\\\nsecurity requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and also incorporate optional WLAN support to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 880G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small to medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and\\\\nprovisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nKey Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n  - **Integrated 3G WWAN broadband: With the 3G WWAN modem integrated into the router, you gain the benefit of**\\\\n\\\\nsimplified installation and management. In addition, the Cisco 3G WWAN are tightly integrated with Cisco integrated\\\\nservices routers, which run the industry-leading Cisco IOS® Software, giving you access to all the advanced features of\\\\nCisco IOS Software such as quality of service (QoS), intelligent network queuing, and robust security.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Short installation time: Businesses sometimes wait for weeks or months to get data circuits installed at new locations. For**\\\\n\\\\ntemporary or seasonal sites, wireless data services allow instant connectivity anywhere there is cellular coverage, and\\\\nrapid deployment allows you to quickly set up networks with WAN connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n- **Network resiliency through WAN diversity: WAN connectivity is crucial to the functioning of your business, and any**\\\\n\\\\ndowntime means a loss of productivity and lost opportunity. Staying connected and operational during a network outage\\\\ncan be vital. A wireless connection for backup to a remote site provides protection against line outages and an additional\\\\nlevel of redundancy because the 3G WWAN infrastructure is often served by separate facilities, providing redundancy for\\\\nthe entire local loop.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Reduced cost: The emerging 3G WWAN cellular data service plans are competitively priced with existing wireline services**\\\\n\\\\n(ISDN, DSL, and cable). 3G WWAN solutions also allow you to consolidate your service providers across large\\\\ngeographical areas instead of having service contracts with multiple service providers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Portability: Cisco 880 with 3G WWAN can be easily relocate wherever coverage is available.**\\\\n\\\\n  - **Performance: With increasing data usage and the proliferation of web-based applications at remote sites, there is an**\\\\n\\\\nincreasing need for high-speed (broadband) data connections to run mission-critical applications at these sites. 3G WWAN\\\\nservices promise low-latency links at speeds approaching T1 connections, allowing you to send and receive more missioncritical data across the WAN in backup scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Specifications\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 provides 3G specifications for the Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Product Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|3G modem form factor|PCI Express card (included with the router)|\\\\n|Programming interfaces|Cisco IOS Software CLI|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|Col3|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|Wireless technologies supported (performance and throughput)|PCEX-3G-HSPA-G ● HSPA: 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz (forward link up to 7.2 Mbps;

The Cisco 819 4G LTE 2.0 M2M is the industry leader to bring enterprise grade wireline\\\\nlike functionality such as Quality of Service (QoS) for cellular, Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF), advanced VPN, and\\\\nUnified Communications solutions over LTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Non-Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Cisco 819 Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs serve as the single, horizontal platform that\\\\nenhances the Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere” across multiple industries, including small business, small remote\\\\nbranch, banking, retail, healthcare, and government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small\\\\nbranch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco\\\\narchitecture.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 3 LTE\\\\nstandards. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The\\\\nfollowing models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819G-4G-GA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800**\\\\n\\\\nMHz (band 3), 2100 MHz (band 1), or 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2), and 2100 MHz (band 1).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **C819G-4G-NA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS),**\\\\n\\\\n850 MHz (band 5), or 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS).\\\\n\\\\n- **C819G-4G-VZ-K9 and C819G-4G-ST-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 13),**\\\\n\\\\n1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), or 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; backward-compatible with EVDO Rev\\\\nA/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819G-LTE-MNA-K9** **and C819HG-LTE-MNA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band**\\\\n\\\\n17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), 850 MHz (band 5), 700 MHz (band 13), 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; or\\\\n1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz (band 5), 900 MHz (band\\\\n8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), with EVDO Rev A/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires\\\\n\\\\nno additional hardware or client software. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for\\\\nexample, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user\\\\nweb traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users\\\\nfrom web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area\\\\n\\\\nApplication Engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications\\\\nattempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and\\\\nthe destination server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. Quality-of-service (QoS) features are included for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n- 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less),\\\\n\\\\nWWAN services are an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average\\\\ndata rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink.\\\\nActual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs offer a\\\\nprimary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G\\\\nLTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either\\\\nnot available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our\\\\nwide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE multiple bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple bearer QoS. Detailed**\\\\n\\\\ninformation on the bearer is part of show CLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and\\\\nrequires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary**\\\\n\\\\nimplementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at\\\\nthe service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this\\\\nservice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can**\\\\n\\\\nbe integrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN Search): UE presents end user with available PLMN search manually. UE can**\\\\n\\\\noptimize PLMN search procedure using stored information such as RF carriers and cell parameters.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition\\\\nto different wireless networks is transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance\\\\ncameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In\\\\naddition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile network or\\\\nsubnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated businessclass security services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G LTE MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional\\\\nmake remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Features|Benefits|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Smallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor||\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATM machines, kiosks, small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries. ● Hardened models extend the ISR footprint into deployments wherein the router is exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, dust, splash water, shock and vibration.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened router\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and\\\\n\\\\noffers both AC and DC power options allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\n\\\\n- The hardened router supports extended temperature ranges from –13 to 140ºF (–25 to 60ºC).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Meets 95 percent of the Non-Condensing Humidity Requirements, IP 41 per IEC 60529 for Vertical Falling Water\\\\n\\\\nand Pollution 3 for Dust.

The 802.11a/b/g/n 2X2 MIMO built in the IR829 creates a selfhealing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated access point can serve as both an\\\\naccess point and a client to a wireless mesh network. This combined functionality provides another source for WAN diversity\\\\nalong with Gigabit Ethernet and cellular. The Cisco ClientLink feature of the access point improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) enables radar detection and avoidance to comply with regulatory\\\\ndomains. The IR829 concurrently supports both 4G LTE wireless WAN and Cisco dual-radio WLAN backhaul on the same\\\\nplatform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Dual active LTE connectivity. With two LTE modems, the IR829 enables concurrent connectivity to two**\\\\ncellular networks for high reliability, enhanced data throughputs, load balancing, and differentiated\\\\nservices. Applicable for IR829M-2LTE and IR829-2LTE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Security services, such as hardware cryptography, including Cisco’s Next Generation Encryption (https**\\\\n://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/next-generation-cryptography.html) that guarantees high\\\\nperformance for IPsec VPN traffic and firewall. Requires no additional hardware or client software. With\\\\nthese security services, fleet vehicle management and mass transit systems, for example, can intelligently\\\\nredirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web\\\\ntraffic. With this solution, businesses can deploy the market-leading web security solution quickly and\\\\neasily to protect assets from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and\\\\nresources.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30**\\\\nmilliseconds or less), WWAN services provide an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services.\\\\nThe single LTE model of the IR829 supports peak data rates of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps\\\\non the uplink. The dual LTE model doubles the throughput by supporting peak data rates of 150 Mbps\\\\non the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink on each of the two cellular links. Actual data speed depends\\\\non the service provider network. With single and dual 4G LTE options, the IR829s offer a flexible,\\\\nredundant cellular connectivity for mission critical services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also\\\\nbe used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or\\\\nvery expensive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIoT gives the transportation industry an opportunity to connect people, improve safety, communicate more effectively, and\\\\nchange transportation centers into community hubs. The IR829 offers the automotive industry - including commercial fleets,\\\\nemergency-response and public safety vehicles, rail, and roadways - standards-based, scalable, and highly secure solutions.\\\\nIR829 meets FirstNet requirements, has passed certification, and supports all FirstNet features.\\\\n\\\\nFleet vehicles\\\\n\\\\nThe IR829 can withstand severe weather and environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, high vibrations, and\\\\nshocks often encountered on buses and trains. The IR829s use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS[®] Software to\\\\nhost networks in motion. Transitioning to different wireless networks is transparent to users and devices (such as laptops, smart\\\\ndevices, sensors and cameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the manual intervention of users as\\\\nWAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the IR829 4G LTE routers allow an entire\\\\nmobile network or subnet to stay connected. The dual-radio 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz WLAN on the IR829 can serve as both a client\\\\nand an access-point. Our products also help transit operators effectively track vehicle fleets through built-in GPS systems.\\\\n\\\\nMass transit\\\\n\\\\nPublic-safety personnel can move critical video data and other sensitive information from incident commanders to field officers\\\\nover a secure network, giving public safety agencies and their personnel access to real-time, multimedia data in the field.

The Cisco 881V and Cisco\\\\n887VA-V voice routers offer industry-leading voice gateway capability with the ability enable Cisco Unified Communications\\\\nManager Express or SRST as required. Many of these customers are connecting computers in offices through WLANs; having a\\\\nsingle device for both WAN and WLAN access provides a new option for managed services. These customers also require a\\\\nhigher level of support to keep their networks operational. Services with these customers should be simple to set up, while\\\\nallowing a level of remote management and troubleshooting to address support inquiries quickly. The Cisco 880 Series meets the\\\\nrequirements of small offices and managed services providers.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2 shows deployment scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Deployment Scenarios\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880 Series is ideally suited for deployment in a small office or in a small office that is part of a large network, most\\\\noften with a secure VPN connection. These types of offices can include the following:\\\\n\\\\n  - Small remote office: The Cisco 880 Series can connect users in a small remote office, such as an insurance, lawyer, or\\\\n\\\\nsales office. When connecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security such as firewall and intrusion\\\\nprevention protect the network at the perimeter. The Cisco 880 with the Cisco Unified Border Element Series can also\\\\nsupport connection to SIP trunking Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services the service provider offers. Additionally, IT managers can\\\\ncentrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot any network problems. For added reliability, customers can also\\\\nuse the integrated 3G or ISDN backup or connect through an external modem if the primary broadband link fails. Integrated\\\\nsecure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management devices at the remote site. Redundant WAN\\\\nlinks offer business continuity, enabling nondisruptive business operation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Virtual office: The Cisco 880 Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers who have a mix of broadband connection types such\\\\n\\\\nas DSL, 3G, and Metro Ethernet. The Cisco 880 Voice Gateway and SRST Series provides a secure virtual office with all\\\\nthe collaborative services such as data, voice, and fax services. SRST helps ensure voice services are operational in case\\\\nof WAN link failure, and redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow\\\\nfor connection of an IP or analog phone to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated\\\\nWLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series helps ensure that if wireless connectivity is used it is secure. (Refer to the Cisco\\\\n[Virtual Office Solution, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo, for more information.)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\n- Remote call-center agent: Similar to teleworking applications, this solution extends the Cisco IP Contact Center solution for\\\\n\\\\ntelephone call-center agents to remote sites. With a high-quality, secure connection through the Cisco 880 Series, callcenter agents can be dispersed away from costly call-center facilities while maintaining secure and productive voice and\\\\ndata access in their homes. SRST and business-continuity solutions in the Cisco 880 Series provide reliability and\\\\ncontinuous business operation. Alternatively, the remote call-center agent can be provided with SIP trunking service with\\\\n\\\\ni d ti id d b Ci U ifi d B d El t f t d th t l ll t f d ll t th\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng q y p y y y ( )\\\\n\\\\nother data security requirements.

The 4G LTE WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits\\\\nof 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G\\\\nLTE data rates, the Cisco 4G LTE 2.0 WWAN offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office\\\\nservices, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in\\\\nareas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and\\\\nadding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity,\\\\nwhich is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up\\\\ncomprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services or the need to lay down the\\\\nlines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet the needs and price points of the business\\\\ncustomer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of\\\\nthe local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 880G and 890G help businesses stay productive during service provider downtime or a network\\\\nfailure with Cisco Intelligent WAN diversity and Cisco Application Visibility & Control (IWAN & AVC LTE support with C890 series). The\\\\n802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO built-in Cisco 3500 Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 897VAGW, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology, to create a\\\\nself-healing, self-optimizing WLAN. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the integrated AP can serve both as an access point and as\\\\na client to a wireless mesh network. This provides another source for WAN diversity along with Gigabit Ethernet, xDSL, and LTE cellular. The\\\\nAP ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices and dynamic frequency selection (DFS allows detecting and\\\\navoiding interference with radar signals to comply with regulatory domains.

The access point’s ClientLink feature improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices, and dynamic frequency\\\\n\\\\nl ti (DFS) ll it t d t t d id i t f ith d i l t l ith l t d i M i f ti\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 9 Category 3 LTE\\\\nstandards. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The\\\\nfollowing models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **Cisco 4G LTE 819GW 2.5: Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate FDD LTE 700-MHz (band 28), 800-MHz (band 20),**\\\\n\\\\n850-MHz (band 5 CLR), 850-MHz (bands 18 and 19 Low), 900-MHz (band 8), 1500-MHz (band 21), 1800-MHz (band 3),\\\\n2100-MHz (band 1), or 2600-MHz (band 7) networks; the multimode 819 4G LTE 2.5 routers are backward-compatible with\\\\nUniversal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) and Dual Carrier High-Speed Packet Access Plus (DC-HSPA)+: 800\\\\nMHz (band 19 Japan), 850 MHz (band 5), 850 MHz (band 6 Japan), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 9), 2100 MHz\\\\n(band 1), and TD-SCDMA 39.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate TDD LTE 1900-MHz (band 39), 2300-MHz (band 40), 2500-MHz\\\\n\\\\n(band 41), or 2600-MHz (band 38) networks.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carrier aggregation band combinations: 1+(8,18,19,21); 3+(5,7,19,28); 7+(5,7,28);\\\\n\\\\n19+21, 38+38, 39+39, 40+40, 41+41.\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires\\\\n\\\\nno additional hardware or client software. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for\\\\nexample, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user\\\\nweb traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch-office users\\\\nfrom web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area\\\\n\\\\nApplication Engine (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications\\\\nattempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and\\\\nthe destination server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. Quality-of-service (QoS) features are included for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE WWAN data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services\\\\n\\\\nare an ideal way to supplement traditional wired-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed\\\\ndepends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running\\\\ncomprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be\\\\nused as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface\\\\nalternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN (packet data networks): This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Names) APN so**\\\\n\\\\nthat Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate traffic. (Available Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The 819 ISRs support 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on**\\\\n\\\\nthe bearer is part of the “show” command, SNMP-MIBs. etc. A service provider is required to launch this service. (Available\\\\nQ4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: The 819 ISRs support Multi Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF) for cellular network. Multi-VRF is**\\\\n\\\\na Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway\\\\n(PGW) as the headend at the service provider’s network. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise-grade unified communication solutions over LTE: The 819 ISRs support voice and video and can be**\\\\n\\\\nintegrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Ability to Host Networks in Motion**\\\\n\\\\nThe 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transitions to\\\\ndifferent wireless networks are transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras),\\\\nand applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Retail VPN**\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the 819 4G LTE\\\\nISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\n**Managed Services**\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small and medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make\\\\nremote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n**Primary Features and Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Features** **Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nSmallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor\\\\n\\\\nSingle platform  - This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATMs, kiosks,\\\\nfor multiple small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries.\\\\napplications\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened  - Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and offers\\\\nrouter both AC and DC power options, allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\nLightweight,  - Can be deployed in many different environments where space, heat dissipation, and low power consumption are critical\\\\ncompact size factors.\\\\nwith low power\\\\nconsumption\\\\n\\\\nIncreased  - Performance allows customers to take advantage of broadband network speeds while running highly secure, concurrent\\\\nperformance data, voice, video, and wireless services.\\\\nto run\\\\nconcurrent\\\\nservices\\\\n\\\\nEnhanced  - An integrated stateful and application inspection firewall provides network perimeter security and high-speed IP Security\\\\nsecurity (IPsec); Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption offer data privacy\\\\n\\\\nover the Internet.\\\\n\\\\n         - Intrusion prevention enforces security policies in a larger enterprise or service provider network.\\\\n\\\\n         - Content filtering offers category-based URL classification and blocking, thus providing increased productivity and better\\\\n\\\\nuse of company resources.\\\\n\\\\n         - ScanSafe web security and filtering solution requires no additional hardware or client software.

In addition, Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and\\\\ndeployment. Centralized management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at\\\\nthe remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nThe dual 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO inbuilt Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 880(G)W, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology,\\\\nIndustry’s first to create a self-healing, self-optimizing wireless network. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the Cisco AP\\\\ncan serve both as an AP and as a client to a wireless mesh network concurrently: Hence providing another source for WAN\\\\ndiversity along with GE interface, cellular. Additionally, the ClientLink feature on the AP improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and the capability to do dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allows detecting and avoiding interfering with radar\\\\nsignals to comply with regulatory domains.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series Wireless Integrated Services Routers with Embedded 3G Wireless\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire-line services. Third-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN\\\\nspeeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21.1 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. You can use the 3G WWAN\\\\nas a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. You can also use the 3G WWAN data\\\\nservices as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services.\\\\n\\\\nSmall Remote Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series connects users in small remote offices, such as those for insurance agents, lawyers, or sales, to the main\\\\noffice. You can use the integrated 3G wireless backup option for added reliability when the primary broadband link fails, or as the\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G,\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow you to connect an IP\\\\nphone to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if you use wireless connectivity, the connection will be secure.

They come in both\\\\nhardened and non-hardened form factors. They are rapidly deployable, highly available, reliable, and secure, and are designed\\\\nspecifically for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. Markets that benefit from these applications include industrial\\\\nautomation, small business, financial, healthcare, and retail. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs\\\\ndeliver enterprise-class features, including highly secure data, voice, and video communications to stationary and mobile network\\\\nnodes across wired and wireless links. The Cisco 819 4G LTE 2.0 M2M is the industry leader to bring enterprise grade wireline\\\\nlike functionality such as Quality of Service (QoS) for cellular, Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF), advanced VPN, and\\\\nUnified Communications solutions over LTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 819 Non-Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Cisco 819 Hardened 4G LTE 2.0 Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA critical component of the Cisco M2M architecture, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs serve as the single, horizontal platform that\\\\nenhances the Cisco implementation of “any device, anywhere” across multiple industries, including small business, small remote\\\\nbranch, banking, retail, healthcare, and government. It also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to small\\\\nbranch offices with a relatively low incremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on Cisco\\\\narchitecture.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs support the latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 3 LTE\\\\nstandards. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The\\\\nfollowing models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819G-4G-GA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 800 MHz (band 20), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800**\\\\n\\\\nMHz (band 3), 2100 MHz (band 1), or 2600 MHz (band 7) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2), and 2100 MHz (band 1).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **C819G-4G-NA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS),**\\\\n\\\\n850 MHz (band 5), or 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz\\\\n(band 5), 900 MHz (band 8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS).\\\\n\\\\n- **C819G-4G-VZ-K9 and C819G-4G-ST-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band 13),**\\\\n\\\\n1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), or 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; backward-compatible with EVDO Rev\\\\nA/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **C819G-LTE-MNA-K9** **and C819HG-LTE-MNA-K9: Multimode Cisco LTE 2.0 for carriers that operate LTE 700 MHz (band**\\\\n\\\\n17), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), 850 MHz (band 5), 700 MHz (band 13), 1900 MHz (band 25 extended PCS) networks; or\\\\n1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS) networks; backward-compatible with UMTS and HSPA+: 850 MHz (band 5), 900 MHz (band\\\\n8), 1900 MHz (band 2 PCS), and 1700/2100 MHz (band 4 AWS), with EVDO Rev A/CDMA 1x BC0, BC1, BC10.\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires\\\\n\\\\nno additional hardware or client software. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for\\\\nexample, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user\\\\nweb traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch office users\\\\nfrom web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area\\\\n\\\\nApplication Engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications\\\\nattempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and\\\\nthe destination server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as Serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. Quality-of-service (QoS) features are included for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n- 4G LTE wireless WAN (WWAN) data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less),\\\\n\\\\nWWAN services are an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average\\\\ndata rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink.\\\\nActual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs offer a\\\\nprimary WAN link capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G\\\\nLTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either\\\\nnot available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our\\\\nwide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**4G LTE multiple bearer QoS for cellular: The Cisco 819 4G LTE supports 4G LTE multiple bearer QoS. Detailed**\\\\n\\\\ninformation on the bearer is part of show CLI, SNMP-MIBs etc. The QoS feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and\\\\nrequires SP to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-VRF for cellular: 4G LTE C819s now support Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a Cisco proprietary**\\\\n\\\\nimplementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires Cisco ASR5K Packet Gateway (P-GW) as the head-end at\\\\nthe service provider’s network. The Multi-VRF feature is service provider (SP) dependent, and requires SP to launch this\\\\nservice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise grade Unified Communication solutions over LTE: The 4G LTE C819s supports voice and video and can**\\\\n\\\\nbe integrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN Search): UE presents end user with available PLMN search manually. UE can**\\\\n\\\\noptimize PLMN search procedure using stored information such as RF carriers and cell parameters.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transition\\\\nto different wireless networks is transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance\\\\ncameras), and applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In\\\\naddition to allowing a single node or device to stay connected, the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs allow an entire mobile network or\\\\nsubnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the Cisco 819 4G\\\\nLTE ISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated businessclass security services for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G LTE MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional\\\\nmake remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n|Features|Benefits|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Smallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor||\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATM machines, kiosks, small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries. ● Hardened models extend the ISR footprint into deployments wherein the router is exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat dissipation, exposure to extreme temperatures, dust, splash water, shock and vibration.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened router\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and\\\\n\\\\noffers both AC and DC power options allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\n\\\\n- The hardened router supports extended temperature ranges from –13 to 140ºF (–25 to 60ºC).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Meets 95 percent of the Non-Condensing Humidity Requirements, IP 41 per IEC 60529 for Vertical Falling Water\\\\n\\\\nand Pollution 3 for Dust.

The document highlights CSP\\'s support for services like Voice and Video over LTE (VoLTE), Rich Communication Suite (RCS), and Converged Messaging, emphasizing its benefits in terms of service delivery, network optimization, and third-party application development.\",\"markdown\":\"# Cisco Converged Services Platform\\\\n\\\\n#### Updated: June 3, 2011 Document ID: 1474005185840804\\\\n Bias-Free Language\\\\n\\\\nMobile subscribers are demanding the same type of services that are provided over the Internet on their mobile phones, including messaging, social\\\\nnetworking, and video sharing. Mobile operators realize the importance of retaining their existing voice-service customers in the emerging all-IP\\\\nworld.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, mobile networks have been evolving over the last few years from second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) and now to all-IP\\\\nnetworks such as Long-Term Evolution LTE and wireless networks. This challenges mobile operators to transition their mobile services\\\\ninfrastructure from a circuit-based to an all-IP architecture, capable of preserving existing voice and Short Message Service (SMS) revenues and\\\\ndelivering enhanced services that take advantage of the higher speed and lower latency of LTE networks.\\\\n\\\\nThis requires a convergence vision that uses the existing 2G and 3G services infrastructure as a part of the converged services core based on IP\\\\nMultimedia Subsystem (IMS) and that opens services capabilities toward the web services domain and mobile application ecosystems. Operators\\\\ncan derive great value by employing cross-domain capabilities to support new IP-based services that transparently coexist with traditional voice and\\\\nmessaging services.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco [®] Converged Services Platform (CSP) allows operators to deploy enhanced voice, video, and messaging services across any generation\\\\nof mobile devices and broadband access networks. Cisco CSP supports a wide range of applications and functionalities to deliver services over 2G,\\\\n\\\\n3G, Wi-Fi and LTE networks - such as Voice and Video over LTE (V [2]oLTE), Rich Communication Suite (RCS) and Converged Messaging - all from a\\\\nsingle platform. Cisco CSP offers solutions for the mobile operators that:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Provide real-time communication services for mobile user communities: voice, video, multimedia, and social messaging for\\\\n revenue generation\\\\n\\\\n • Provide network optimization: social network aggregation, voice and message routing and media delivery over IP for cost\\\\n reduction\\\\n\\\\n • Provide open network interfaces to support third-party application development for new business models\\\\n\\\\nMobile operators can deploy the services they want, when they want to deploy them, on the Cisco Converged Services Platform.\\\\n\\\\n#### Platform for Convergence\\\\n\\\\nCisco CSP applications are based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and HTTP, and comply with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP),\\\\n3GPP2, IETF, and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specifications such as Multimedia Telephony (MMTel), OMA SIMPLE Presence and instant messaging,\\\\nand OMA Converged IP Messaging (CPM). The platform supports industry-standard interfaces to connect with existing mobile access networks;\\\\nmobile core networks; SIP, voice over IP (VoIP), and IMS core networks; web services through representational state transfer (REST); and broadband\\\\nIP access networks including LTE over open-standard interfaces.\\\\n\\\\nAs shown in Figure 1, Cisco CSP is packaged with a software framework that supports rapid service development and delivery across multiple\\\\nnetwork domains-circuit, SIP, and web. The platform consists of an application layer with functional modules, providing the service logic to deliver\\\\nservices in the network. This layer uses a services and subscriber profile layer, which includes sophisticated routing and carrier-grade capabilities to\\\\ndeliver personalized services with flexible deployment options that include geographic redundancy. These functions connect to a common interface\\\\nabstraction layer, providing the flexibility to link any application service logic or function to any element in the network to provide convergence across\\\\nservice domains. This modular and layered software architecture allows Cisco to deliver blended services across access domains and core\\\\nnetworks.\\\\n\\\\n#### Figure 1. Cisco Converged Services Platform Software Architecture\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nFor mobile operators, Cisco CSP delivers:\\\\n\\\\n#### • Rapid IP-based service delivery across 2G, 3G, Wi-Fi and LTE domains and devices\\\\n • Voice, video, and messaging services deployed on a single platform, reducing operational expenses\\\\n • Investment protection in circuit-switch-domain equipment by using existing core network assets such as Mobile Switching\\\\n Center (MSC), Home Location Register (HLR), and SMS-C to provide convergence across IMS and traditional domains.\\\\n\\\\n • Interoperability with the Cisco ASR 5000 Series and third-party IMS core and applications servers in a typical multivendor\\\\n network\\\\n\\\\n • Flexible deployment options such as separated application servers and centralized or distributed architectures\\\\n • Fully redundant hardware, 99.999 percent reliability, and georedundant deployment options\\\\n • High scalability and flexibility to optimize application-specific capacity\\\\n\\\\n Cisco CSP Solutions\\\\n\\\\n Voice and Video over LTE (V[2]oLTE)\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco V [2]oLTE solution allows LTE operators to preserve their revenues with a core voice, video, SMS and Multimedia Message Service (MMS)\\\\nservices delivery over LTE. This MMTel solution offers service parity with 2G and 3G voice services including interworking, mobility, and single\\\\nnumber identity. Cisco CSP also provides options for LTE operators to achieve rapid time-to-market for V [2]oLTE by using existing assets such as the\\\\nMSC in the evolution to IMS. Cisco CSP supports functionalities to route SMS and MMS traffic over IMS for delivery over LTE devices.\\\\n\\\\n#### Rich Communications Suite (RCS)\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco CSP RCS solution provides new services over 3G and 4G devices, which include social profile, social presence, instant messaging and\\\\nchat, file transfer, and video streaming as mobile operators launch globally interoperable, socially interactive services to build loyal mobile\\\\ncommunities. The solution also includes support for RCSe, which simply introduces new services for IM and chat, file transfer, and video sharing to\\\\nnative device address books. Cisco CSP supports all the application servers required to deploy RCS and RCSe, and the connectors to blend RCS\\\\nservices with web-based social networks and applications.\\\\n\\\\n#### Converged Messaging\\\\n\\\\nOMA converged messaging empowers 2G, 3G, and LTE operators to transform their messaging core while introducing new services to end users.\\\\nThe Cisco CSP solution for converged messaging supports functionality for multidevice delivery, group messaging, media transfer, instant\\\\nmessaging and chat, message management policy, and message storage.\\\\n\\\\n#### Femtocell Services\\\\n\\\\nThe femtocel solution delivers voice and messaging services, using an all-IP core, to devices connected over IP-based femtocells. Cisco CSP\\\\nsupports the application servers to deliver MMTel, GSM and UMTS, MAP or CDMA ANSI 41 services to connect 2G (GSM and CDMA), and 3G-CS\\\\nfemtocells directly into an IMS core to provide voice and messaging services.\\\\n\\\\n#### SMS and MMS Services\\\\n\\\\nThe SMS and MMS Messaging solution on the Cisco CSP helps operators monetize mobile messaging by either increasing revenue-generating\\\\ntraffic or by simply reducing costs in existing infrastructure. Personalized services such as message forwarding; copying to SMS, MMS, or email;\\\\ngroup messaging; and autoreplyprovide a comprehensive user experience Mobile operators can offer new services such as spam filtering and\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco CSP optimizes social network traffic to lower costs for operators and provide an enhanced experience to consumers.

Transparently integrated into the enterprise-class feature set available on the Cisco 880 Series, 3G wireless connectivity\\\\nallows rapid installation, deployment flexibility, and resilient WAN backup.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nCisco 880 Series Integrated Services Routers are the next generation of fixed-configuration routers that provide collaborative\\\\nbusiness solutions for secure data communication to small businesses and enterprise teleworkers. The 3G wireless option\\\\navailable on these routers offers a cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure backup solution. With data rates\\\\napproaching T1 speeds, 3G wireless can be used for primary WAN connectivity in locations where wireline services such as DSL\\\\nand ISDN are not available or are too expensive to deploy.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Routers support the latest 3G standards (High-Speed Packet Access [HSPA] and\\\\nEV-DO Rev A) and are backward-compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), Enhanced Data Rates\\\\nfor Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 880G Series has two\\\\nvariants (refer to Table 1 for part numbers):\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on 3GPP, and they support HSPA (High\\\\nSpeed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A/Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to 3G wireless WAN, the Cisco 880G Series offers additional WAN options such as xDSL and Fast Ethernet WAN\\\\ninterface, a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed switch with VLAN support and the latest 802.11n WLAN capability. The Cisco\\\\n880 Series provides the performance required for concurrent services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, content filtering,\\\\nand encryption for VPNs; and quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications. In addition, Cisco\\\\nConfiguration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management\\\\ncapabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series 3G Wireless Integrated Services Routers\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire line services. 3G WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with\\\\ntheoretical limits in excess of 7 Mbps on the downlink and 5 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G WWAN can be use as a primary link for\\\\nsites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. The 3G WWAN data services can also be use as a costeffective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these\\\\nperformance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\ng p p y p y\\\\n\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow an IP phone to be\\\\nconnected to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if wireless connectivity is to be used, the connection will be secure. (Refer to Cisco Business-Ready Teleworker\\\\n[Solutions for more information, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G wireless option on the Cisco 880G\\\\nSeries for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry (PCI) and other data\\\\nsecurity requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the\\\\nincreased bandwidth and also incorporate optional WLAN support to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 880G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small to medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support with 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and\\\\nprovisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nKey Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n  - **Integrated 3G WWAN broadband: With the 3G WWAN modem integrated into the router, you gain the benefit of**\\\\n\\\\nsimplified installation and management. In addition, the Cisco 3G WWAN are tightly integrated with Cisco integrated\\\\nservices routers, which run the industry-leading Cisco IOS® Software, giving you access to all the advanced features of\\\\nCisco IOS Software such as quality of service (QoS), intelligent network queuing, and robust security.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Short installation time: Businesses sometimes wait for weeks or months to get data circuits installed at new locations. For**\\\\n\\\\ntemporary or seasonal sites, wireless data services allow instant connectivity anywhere there is cellular coverage, and\\\\nrapid deployment allows you to quickly set up networks with WAN connectivity.\\\\n\\\\n- **Network resiliency through WAN diversity: WAN connectivity is crucial to the functioning of your business, and any**\\\\n\\\\ndowntime means a loss of productivity and lost opportunity. Staying connected and operational during a network outage\\\\ncan be vital. A wireless connection for backup to a remote site provides protection against line outages and an additional\\\\nlevel of redundancy because the 3G WWAN infrastructure is often served by separate facilities, providing redundancy for\\\\nthe entire local loop.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **Reduced cost: The emerging 3G WWAN cellular data service plans are competitively priced with existing wireline services**\\\\n\\\\n(ISDN, DSL, and cable). 3G WWAN solutions also allow you to consolidate your service providers across large\\\\ngeographical areas instead of having service contracts with multiple service providers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Portability: Cisco 880 with 3G WWAN can be easily relocate wherever coverage is available.**\\\\n\\\\n  - **Performance: With increasing data usage and the proliferation of web-based applications at remote sites, there is an**\\\\n\\\\nincreasing need for high-speed (broadband) data connections to run mission-critical applications at these sites. 3G WWAN\\\\nservices promise low-latency links at speeds approaching T1 connections, allowing you to send and receive more missioncritical data across the WAN in backup scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Specifications\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 provides 3G specifications for the Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Product Specifications\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|3G modem form factor|PCI Express card (included with the router)|\\\\n|Programming interfaces|Cisco IOS Software CLI|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Item|Specification|Col3|\\\\n|---|---|---|\\\\n|Wireless technologies supported (performance and throughput)|PCEX-3G-HSPA-G ● HSPA: 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz (forward link up to 7.2 Mbps;

The 890G Series provides a rapidly deployable, highly available,\\\\nreliable, and secure solution designed to combine Internet access, comprehensive security, and wireless services in a single device that is\\\\neasy to deploy and manage for primary or backup connectivity (Figure 1). Customers that would benefit from these routers include small\\\\nbusinesses, remote small or medium-sized or power branches, financial services firms, healthcare organizations, pop-up stores, point-of-sale\\\\nsystems, and retail businesses. Fully integrated with Cisco IOS Software, the 890G Series routers deliver enterprise-class features, including\\\\nhighly secure data, voice, and video communications, to stationary and mobile network nodes across wired and wireless links. The best-inclass Cisco 890G Series architecture is specifically designed to deliver high performance with concurrent services, business continuity, and\\\\ninvestment protection. These ISRs are the industry leader in bringing enterprise-grade wired-line-like functionality such as quality of service\\\\n(QoS) for cellular, Multi-VRF, advanced VPN, and unified communications solutions over LTE.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco C899G Integrated Services Router\\\\n\\\\nThe 890G Series also provides the ability to extend Cisco product-based networks to remote power branch offices with a relatively low\\\\nincremental investment, as well as to enable managed services offerings based on end-to-end Cisco system architecture.\\\\n\\\\nProduct Overview\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 890G Series Fourth-Generation Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) 2.5 ISRs are fixed-configuration routers that provide collaborative\\\\nbusiness solutions for secure voice and data communications to enterprise small branch offices, with support for the latest Third-Generation\\\\nPartnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 4 LTE standards. They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and\\\\ntransparent handoff to earlier technologies. The routers are designed to deliver secure broadband, Metro Ethernet, or any xDSL variants,\\\\nwireless WAN (WWAN) connectivity, and business continuity. They also come with powerful management tools, such as the web-based Cisco\\\\nConfiguration Professional configuration management tool, which simplifies setup and deployment.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Cisco 4G LTE 890G 2.5: Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate FDD LTE 700-MHz (band 28), 850-MHz (band 5 CLR), 850-MHz**\\\\n\\\\n(bands 18 and 19 Low), 900-MHz (band 8), 1500-MHz (band 21), 1800-MHz (band 3), 2100-MHz (band 1), or 2600-MHz (band 7)\\\\nnetworks; the multimode 890G Series 4G LTE 2.5 routers are backward compatible with Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service\\\\n(UMTS) and Dual Carrier High-Speed Packet Access Plus (DC-HSPA+): 800 MHz (band 19 Japan), 850 MHz (band 5), 850 MHz (band\\\\n6 Japan), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 9), 2100 MHz (band 1), and TD-SCDMA 39.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate TDD LTE 1900-MHz (band 39), 2300-MHz (band 40), 2500-MHz (band 41), or\\\\n\\\\n2600-MHz (band 38) networks.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carrier aggregation band combinations: 1+(8,18,19,21); 3+(5,7,19,28); 7+(5,7,28); 19+21, 38+38,\\\\n\\\\n39+39, 40+40, 41+41.\\\\n\\\\nThe 890G Series ISRs provide a broad range of enterprise-class features, including:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWith this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch-office users from web-based\\\\nthreats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options, such as Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and an 8-port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet managed switch for LAN\\\\n\\\\nconnectivity. The Cisco 890G Series ISRs provide quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management\\\\n\\\\ncapabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - WWAN services, offering enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 ms or less)—an ideal way to supplement traditional wired-line\\\\n\\\\nservices. The 4G LTE WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits\\\\nof 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. The actual data speed depends on the service provider’s network. With 4G\\\\nLTE data rates, the WWAN offers a primary WAN link solution capable of running comprehensive branch-office services, including\\\\nvoice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband\\\\nservices are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless\\\\nto our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless connectivity,\\\\nwhich is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up\\\\ncomprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services or the need to lay down the\\\\nlines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet the needs and price points of the business\\\\ncustomer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of\\\\nthe local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco 890G Series helps businesses stay productive during service provider downtime or a network\\\\nfailure with Cisco Intelligent WAN (IWAN) diversity.\\\\n\\\\nAbility to Host Networks in Motion\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 890G Series uses standards-based mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transitions to different\\\\nwireless networks are transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras), and applications\\\\nmaintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to allowing a single node or device\\\\nto stay connected, the 890G Series allows an entire mobile network or subnet to stay connected.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 4G LTE WWAN option on the 890G Series for lowcost broadband access, with the security required to comply with payment card industry (PCI) and other data security requirements. Multiple\\\\ndevices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable secure\\\\nmobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers (VARs) can use the 890G Series as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security\\\\nservices for small and medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities, such as Simple Network Management Protocol\\\\n(SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional, make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple packet data networks: This feature allows configuration of multiple active access point names so that Internet traffic can be**\\\\n\\\\nkept separate from corporate traffic.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The 890G Series supports 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on the**\\\\n\\\\nbearer is part of the “show” command, SNMP-MIBs, etc. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF) for cellular: 4G LTE 2.5 now supports Multi-VRF for cellular network. Multi-VRF is a**\\\\n\\\\nCisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway (PGW) as the\\\\nheadend at the service provider’s network. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise-grade unified communications solutions over LTE: The 890G Series supports voice and video and can be integrated**\\\\n\\\\nwith Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN Search): User equipment (UE) presents the end user with available PLMN search manually. UE**\\\\n\\\\ncan optimize PLMN search procedures using stored information such as RF carriers and cell parameters.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits of the Cisco 890G Series 4G LTE 2.5 ISRs\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefits|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Cisco ISR in Form Factors||\\\\n|Lightweight, compact size with low power consumption|● Can be deployed in many different environments where space, heat dissipation, and low power consumption are critical factors.|\\\\n|Increased performance to run concurrent services|● Performance allows customers to take advantage of broadband network speeds while running secure, concurrent data, voice, video, and wireless services.|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefits|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Enhanced security|● An integrated stateful and application inspection firewall provides network perimeter security and high-speed IP Security (IPsec); Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption offer data privacy over the Internet. ● Intrusion prevention enforces security policies in a larger enterprise or service provider network. ● Content filtering offers category-based URL classification and blocking, thus helping increase productivity and providing better use of company resources. ● ScanSafe web security and filtering solution requires no additional hardware or client software.

The Cisco 812 CiFi includes an integrated WLAN access point.\\\\n\\\\n  - Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and they support HSPA+\\\\n\\\\n(High-Speed Uplink Packet Access [HSUPA] and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access [HSDPA]), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\\\\n\\\\n  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A and Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 812 CiFi ISR family includes a broad range of enterprise-class features including:\\\\n\\\\n  - Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe which require no additional hardware or client\\\\n\\\\nsoftware, This enables Enterprise branch, remote branch offices, temporary sites, and retails, for example to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to\\\\nenforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user web traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to\\\\nprotect branch office users from web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n  - Additional WAN options such as Gigabit Ethernet WAN interface, the Cisco 812 CiFi provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video\\\\n\\\\napplications.\\\\n\\\\n  - Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management capabilities give network\\\\n\\\\nmanagers visibility and control of the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n  - With enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement traditional wire line services. Third\\\\ngeneration WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21.1 Mbps on the\\\\ndownlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. The 3G/3.7G WWAN can be used as a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements. The 3G/3.7G data\\\\nservices can also be used as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on\\\\nthese performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 3G/3.7G wireless connectivity, allows a small enterprise\\\\nbranch office or remote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services and the need for\\\\nlaying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As\\\\nWAN backup alternatives, 3G/3.7G wireless offer greater WAN diversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The Cisco\\\\n812 CiFi ISR enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure. The dual 802.11n radio WLAN on the 812 CiFi ISR can\\\\nserve as both a client and an access-point.\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G or 3.7G wireless WAN option on the Cisco 812 CiFi ISR for low-cost\\\\nbroadband access with the required security to comply with data security requirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to\\\\ntake advantage of the increased bandwidth and to enable secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\nManaged Services\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the Cisco 812 CiFi ISR as a platform to offer differentiated business-class security and wireless LAN (WLAN)\\\\nservices for small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support\\\\nwith 3G MIB and Cisco Configuration Professional make remote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\nPrimary Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 812 CiFi Integrated Services Router.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits of Cisco 812 CiFi ISR\\\\n\\\\n|Feature|Benefit|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Single platform for multiple applications|● This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, temporary locations, retail, hotspots and extension to Enterprise location.|\\\\n|Increased performance to run concurrent services|● Performance allows customers to take advantage of broadband network speeds while running secure, concurrent data, voice, video, and wireless services.|\\\\n|Enhanced security|● An integrated stateful and application inspection firewall provides network perimeter security and high-speed IP Security (IPsec); 3DES and AES encryption offer data privacy over the Internet. ● Intrusion prevention enforces security policies in a larger enterprise or service provider network. ● Content filtering offers category-based URL classification and blocking, thus providing increased productivity and better use of company resources. ● ScanSafe web security and filtering solution that requires no additional hardware or client software.

In addition, Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and\\\\ndeployment. Centralized management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at\\\\nthe remote site.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless\\\\nconnectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about\\\\navailability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans\\\\nthat can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless\\\\noffers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses\\\\nto stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\nThe dual 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO inbuilt Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 880(G)W, comes with Cisco’s CleanAir technology,\\\\nIndustry’s first to create a self-healing, self-optimizing wireless network. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the Cisco AP\\\\ncan serve both as an AP and as a client to a wireless mesh network concurrently: Hence providing another source for WAN\\\\ndiversity along with GE interface, cellular. Additionally, the ClientLink feature on the AP improves reliability and coverage for\\\\nlegacy devices and the capability to do dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allows detecting and avoiding interfering with radar\\\\nsignals to comply with regulatory domains.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 880G Series Wireless Integrated Services Routers with Embedded 3G Wireless\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement\\\\ntraditional wire-line services. Third-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN\\\\nspeeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21.1 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. You can use the 3G WWAN\\\\nas a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. You can also use the 3G WWAN data\\\\nservices as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nKey Business Benefits\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for deployment by small businesses, retail locations, small branch offices that are part of a large\\\\nenterprise network, and a host of other deployments that need high-speed wireless connectivity and secure data, voice, and\\\\nwireless services.\\\\n\\\\nSmall Remote Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series connects users in small remote offices, such as those for insurance agents, lawyers, or sales, to the main\\\\noffice. You can use the integrated 3G wireless backup option for added reliability when the primary broadband link fails, or as the\\\\nprimary connection for deployments that are portable, such as insurance adjustment, mobile banking, and mobile retail. When\\\\nconnecting to the main office, VPN encryption and integrated security features such as firewall and intrusion prevention protect\\\\nthe network at every perimeter. IT managers can centrally manage the remote site to quickly troubleshoot network problems.\\\\nIntegrated secure unified WLAN connectivity simplifies the deployment and management of devices at the remote site.\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Office\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 880G Series is ideal for corporate teleworkers, who might have a mix of broadband connection types such as DS, 3G,\\\\nand Ethernet. The Cisco 880G Series provides a secure virtual office with all the collaborative services such as data, voice, and\\\\nvideo. Redundant WAN links help ensure business continuity. QoS features in the Cisco 880 Series allow you to connect an IP\\\\nphone to the router, giving voice traffic precedence over data applications. Integrated WLAN support in the Cisco 880 Series\\\\nhelps ensure that if you use wireless connectivity, the connection will be secure. (Refer to Cisco Business-Ready Teleworker\\\\n[Solutions for more information, https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo.)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cvo)\\\\n\\\\nRetail VPN\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the 3G wireless option on the Cisco 880G\\\\nSeries for low-cost broadband access with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry (PCI) and other data\\\\nsecurity requirements.

The Cisco 4G LTE\\\\nWIM can provide either primary connectivity or backup communications, offering network resiliency for business continuity. With\\\\ngreater agility and speed to deployment than wired solutions, 4G LTE can reduce network cost, and it complements wire-line\\\\npublic and private network access. Practical applications of 4G LTE for organizations include parallel networks, primary\\\\nconnection, failover, in-vehicle connectivity, network convergence, and last-mile diversity. It provides enterprise-class wireless\\\\nWAN (WWAN) connectivity that is used for both backup and primary applications. The 4G LTE WIM with the Cisco 800M ISR\\\\nleads the industry in bringing enterprise-grade functions such as Quality of Service (QoS), Multi-Virtual Route Forwarding (MultiVRF), advanced VPN, and unified communications solutions over LTE.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco 4G LTE WIM (Figure 1) provides an enterprise-class 4G multimode LTE WWAN solution. With the Cisco 800M ISR, 4G\\\\nLTE is a powerful primary WAN access solution. Businesses can now run applications such as interactive video and telepresence\\\\non a primary 4G LTE connection, which is up to 50 times faster with far lower latency than 3G links. These 4G modules support\\\\nthe latest Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 Category 4 LTE standards. The Cisco 4G multimode LTE WIM\\\\nprovides persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The card provides\\\\nbandwidth to support high-definition (HD) and peer-to-peer (P2P) video calls, providing customers with an excellent mobile\\\\nbroadband experience. The 4G LTE WIM is tightly integrated with the services provided on the Cisco 800M ISR, which delivers\\\\nsecure data, video, and mobility services. The WIM is supported on the Cisco 800M ISR only.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 1.** Cisco 4G LTE WIM for the 800M ISR\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 2.** Cisco 800M ISR (C841M-8X) with the 4G LTE WIM in slot 1\\\\n\\\\nOrdering information\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 gives ordering information for the 4G LTE WIM, and Tables 2 and 3 give the specifications.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Ordering information\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Part**\\\\n**number**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Description** **Supported platforms and**\\\\n**quantity**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Minimum Cisco IOS[®] Software**\\\\n**release**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nAS(=)\\\\nWIM-LTELT(=)\\\\nWIM-LTEAL(=)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nModule C841M-8X)\\\\n1 module per chassis\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Table 2.** 4G LTE WIM specifications\\\\n\\\\n**Feature** **Specification**\\\\n\\\\nProduct ID WIM-LTE\\\\n\\\\nLTE modem form factor Pluggable WAN interface module\\\\n\\\\nDimensions (HxWxD) 1.65 x 3.97 x 4.96 in./4.2 x 10 x 12.6 cm\\\\n\\\\nWeight 0.4 kg/0.8 lb\\\\n\\\\nSoftware compatibility Main features include:\\\\n\\\\n                    -

They provide persistent, reliable LTE connectivity with fallback and transparent handoff to earlier technologies. The\\\\nfollowing models are available:\\\\n\\\\n  - **Cisco 4G LTE 819GW 2.5: Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate FDD LTE 700-MHz (band 28), 800-MHz (band 20),**\\\\n\\\\n850-MHz (band 5 CLR), 850-MHz (bands 18 and 19 Low), 900-MHz (band 8), 1500-MHz (band 21), 1800-MHz (band 3),\\\\n2100-MHz (band 1), or 2600-MHz (band 7) networks; the multimode 819 4G LTE 2.5 routers are backward-compatible with\\\\nUniversal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) and Dual Carrier High-Speed Packet Access Plus (DC-HSPA)+: 800\\\\nMHz (band 19 Japan), 850 MHz (band 5), 850 MHz (band 6 Japan), 900 MHz (band 8), 1800 MHz (band 9), 2100 MHz\\\\n(band 1), and TD-SCDMA 39.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carriers that operate TDD LTE 1900-MHz (band 39), 2300-MHz (band 40), 2500-MHz\\\\n\\\\n(band 41), or 2600-MHz (band 38) networks.\\\\n\\\\n◦ Multimode LTE 2.5 for carrier aggregation band combinations: 1+(8,18,19,21); 3+(5,7,19,28); 7+(5,7,28);\\\\n\\\\n19+21, 38+38, 39+39, 40+40, 41+41.\\\\n\\\\n**The Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs include a broad range of enterprise-class features:**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Security services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN, and Cisco ISR Web Security with ScanSafe, which requires\\\\n\\\\nno additional hardware or client software. This enables branch offices, manufacturing sites, hospitals, and banks, for\\\\nexample, to intelligently redirect web traffic to the cloud to enforce granular security and acceptable use policies over user\\\\nweb traffic. With this solution, you can deploy market-leading web security quickly and easily to protect branch-office users\\\\nfrom web-based threats, such as viruses, while saving bandwidth, money, and resources.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco WAN optimization system, consisting of Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express routers and Wide Area\\\\n\\\\nApplication Engine (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic in your network. When client and server applications\\\\nattempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts the traffic and acts on behalf of the client application and\\\\nthe destination server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Additional WAN options such as serial and Gigabit Ethernet WAN interfaces and a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed\\\\n\\\\nswitch for LAN connectivity. Quality-of-service (QoS) features are included for optimizing voice and video applications.\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco Configuration Professional, a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized\\\\n\\\\nmanagement capabilities give network managers visibility into and control over the network configurations at remote sites.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - 4G LTE WWAN data services. With enhanced data rates and improved latency (30 milliseconds or less), WWAN services\\\\n\\\\nare an ideal way to supplement traditional wired-line services. 4G LTE WWAN data services have average data rates well\\\\nin excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits of 100 Mbps on the downlink and 50 Mbps on the uplink. Actual data speed\\\\ndepends on the service provider’s network. With 4G LTE data rates, the ISRs offer a primary WAN link capable of running\\\\ncomprehensive branch-office services, including voice and video services. The 4G LTE WWAN data services can also be\\\\nused as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is\\\\nbuilding on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface\\\\nalternatives.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multiple-PDN (packet data networks): This feature allows configuration of multiple active (Access Point Names) APN so**\\\\n\\\\nthat Internet traffic can be kept separate from the corporate traffic. (Available Q4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS for cellular: The 819 ISRs support 4G LTE multiple-bearer QoS. Detailed information on**\\\\n\\\\nthe bearer is part of the “show” command, SNMP-MIBs. etc. A service provider is required to launch this service. (Available\\\\nQ4, 2016)\\\\n\\\\n  - **Multi-VRF for cellular: The 819 ISRs support Multi Virtual Route Forwarding (Multi-VRF) for cellular network. Multi-VRF is**\\\\n\\\\na Cisco proprietary implementation over and above the 3GPP spec and requires a Cisco ASR 5000 Packet Gateway\\\\n(PGW) as the headend at the service provider’s network. A service provider is required to launch this service.\\\\n\\\\n  - **Enterprise-grade unified communication solutions over LTE: The 819 ISRs support voice and video and can be**\\\\n\\\\nintegrated with Cisco Unified Communications cloud or premises-based infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Benefits and Application Examples\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. The 4G LTE wireless\\\\nconnectivity, which is 10 to 15 times faster and has 5 times lower latency than 3G links, allows a small enterprise branch office or\\\\nremote office to set up comprehensive media services in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband\\\\nservices and the need to lay down lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be customized to meet\\\\nthe needs and price points of the business customer. As WAN backup alternatives, 3G and 4G LTE wireless offer greater WAN\\\\ndiversity and resiliency because they are independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. The 819 4G LTE ISRs enable\\\\nbusinesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\\\\n\\\\n**Ability to Host Networks in Motion**\\\\n\\\\nThe 819 4G LTE ISRs use standards-based Mobile IP features in Cisco IOS Software to host networks in motion. Transitions to\\\\ndifferent wireless networks are transparent to the users and devices (such as laptops, smart devices, and surveillance cameras),\\\\nand applications maintain continuous connectivity without the user’s manual intervention as WAN links change. In addition to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Retail VPN**\\\\n\\\\nRetail stores migrating from dialup connections for point-of-sale transactions can use the WWAN capability of the 819 4G LTE\\\\nISRs for low-cost broadband access, with the required security to comply with payment-card-industry and other data security\\\\nrequirements. Multiple devices and applications can then be added to the store network to take advantage of the increased\\\\nbandwidth and to enable highly secure mobility and enhance productivity.\\\\n\\\\n**Managed Services**\\\\n\\\\nService providers and value-added resellers can use the 819 4G LTE ISRs as a platform to offer differentiated business-class\\\\nsecurity and WLAN services for small and medium-sized business customers. Superior management capabilities such as Simple\\\\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) support for 3G MIB with 4G MIB extension and Cisco Configuration Professional make\\\\nremote management and provisioning easier.\\\\n\\\\n**Primary Features and Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nTable 1 lists the features and benefits of the Cisco 819 4G LTE ISRs.\\\\n\\\\n**Table 1.** Features and Benefits\\\\n\\\\n**Features** **Benefits**\\\\n\\\\nSmallest Cisco ISR in Non-Hardened Form Factor\\\\n\\\\nSingle platform  - This single architecture is uniquely designed for deployments in multiple remote applications such as ATMs, kiosks,\\\\nfor multiple small branch offices, remote teleworker sites, gas stations, and telemetry, and across all industries.\\\\napplications\\\\n\\\\nNon-hardened  - Supports a variety of mounting options, including 35-mm din-rail per EN60715, floor mount, and wall mount, and offers\\\\nrouter both AC and DC power options, allowing for deployment flexibility.\\\\nmounting\\\\n\\\\nLightweight,  - Can be deployed in many different environments where space, heat dissipation, and low power consumption are critical\\\\ncompact size factors.\\\\nwith low power\\\\nconsumption\\\\n\\\\nIncreased  - Performance allows customers to take advantage of broadband network speeds while running highly secure, concurrent\\\\nperformance data, voice, video, and wireless services.\\\\nto run\\\\nconcurrent\\\\nservices\\\\n\\\\nEnhanced  - An integrated stateful and application inspection firewall provides network perimeter security and high-speed IP Security\\\\nsecurity (IPsec); Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption offer data privacy\\\\n\\\\nover the Internet.\\\\n\\\\n         - Intrusion prevention enforces security policies in a larger enterprise or service provider network.\\\\n\\\\n         - Content filtering offers category-based URL classification and blocking, thus providing increased productivity and better\\\\n\\\\nuse of company resources.\\\\n\\\\n         - ScanSafe web security and filtering solution requires no additional hardware or client software.

Cows and Dogs are Animals. Cows eat\\\\nHerbs, which is a Plant”\\\\n\\\\ncan be represented by the following graph.\\\\n\\\\n## Summary\\\\n\\\\nAs an engineer, you have built a system that collects knowledge graphs from text\\\\nin a large organisation. This organisation in particular is a manufacturer, and the\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nknowledge graph is related to their supply chain - namely: who are their suppliers\\\\nand which products they manufacture.\\\\n\\\\n[You will find the knowledge graph here - kg.json. It is a dictionary of two](https://github.com/ergodic-ai/samples/tree/main)\\\\ncomponents: nodes and edges. The data model for these is quite straightforward.\\\\n[In the same repository you will find a texts.json file, which contains a stream of](https://github.com/ergodic-ai/samples/blob/main/texts.json)\\\\ntexts.\\\\n\\\\n## Task\\\\n\\\\nThere are two parts of this task, one which involves a backend manipulation and\\\\nquerying of the graph object - and a front-end. You may use whatever stack you\\\\nwant for both the backend and the front-end. You can create a repo of your own\\\\nand ship the code into this repo when you are finished.\\\\n\\\\nFor questions that don’t require technical implementation you can write your\\\\nthoughts in the README.md\\\\n\\\\nIf there’s not enough time for everything, feel free to prioritise as you see fit. If you\\\\nhave any additional thoughts or think that there’s something more exciting that can\\\\nbe done with the question, also feel free to go ahead and write it down / code it.\\\\n\\\\n## Backend\\\\n\\\\nWhile there’s a lot of information in these graphs, it’s also very important for users\\\\nto be able to:\\\\n\\\\n1) Understand all of the information related to entities in the graph, for\\\\n\\\\ninstance:\\\\n\\\\n    - Which products are manufactured by which supplier?\\\\n\\\\n    - Where are certain products manufactured?\\\\n\\\\n    - What would happen if there was a natural disaster in a given city?).\\\\n\\\\nTo do that, based on the data, can you come up with whichever endpoints you\\\\nthink could be interesting to facilitate the development of the application that\\\\nqueries this graph, motivated by these questions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n2) Given two nodes, how are they related? What are all the intermediate edges\\\\n\\\\nand nodes that connect two nodes in the graph?\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore:\\\\n\\\\n3) I have a heavy ML task which accepts a natural language question, the\\\\n\\\\ngraph and returns a natural language output.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef my_heavy_task( question: str, graph: GraphModel ) -> str:\\\\n   time.sleep(1000)\\\\n   return \\\\\"finished\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nOnce the user asks the question, we need to return a task_id for this job,\\\\n\\\\nand schedule it somehow so it doesn’t block the entire API. How would you\\\\nimplement this - depending on the volume of queries and amount of data used.\\\\n**We don’t need a full implementation, just a high level technical overview.**\\\\n\\\\n## Frontend\\\\n\\\\n[Take a look at the texts.json file, which contains the stream of texts. Some of the](https://github.com/ergodic-ai/samples/blob/main/texts.json)\\\\nentities in the graph are mentioned in the text. For instance,\\\\n\\\\n“Global Raw Materials Inc., located in Country A, is a leading supplier of\\\\n_essential raw materials, including Aluminum (Grade 6061-T6) and Polypropylene_\\\\n**_plastic resin.”_**\\\\n\\\\nYou can assume that there’s a 1-1 relationship between the “name” field in the\\\\nentity node and the way that the entity is displayed in the text, so no complex\\\\nentity matching is necessary.\\\\n\\\\n1) Let’s assume that these texts are part of a communication feed - i.e., the\\\\n\\\\nuser is receiving these messages from internal systems. How would you\\\\ndisplay these messages and enrich the information displayed with the\\\\nknowledge graph in a clean way?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n2) Think about the opposite problem - what if I want to filter all the messages\\\\n\\\\nthat mention a certain entity?\\\\n\\\\n3) Which other ways can you think about displaying the information in the\\\\n\\\\ngraph (or a subset of it) that highlights the connections between different\\\\nentities but doesn’t overwhelm the user? (keep in mind that in real\\\\napplications, a knowledge graph will have tens of thousands of variables so\\\\na single “react flow” type of application isn’t feasible.\\\\n\\\\n   - Again, for this one, we don’t need a full implementation, but rather\\\\nhigh level thoughts about the type of structure that would be ideal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n\",\"fileMetadata\":{\"format\":\"PDF 1.4\",\"title\":\"Ergodic - Full Stack Engineer task\",\"author\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"creator\":\"\",\"producer\":\"Skia/PDF m131 Google Docs Renderer\",\"creationDate\":\"\",\"modDate\":\"\",\"trapped\":\"\",\"encryption\":null},\"candidateCollections\":[{\"uuid\":\"0e21aaad-4f3d-43ec-b7bc-57fe4c84bb2e\",\"description\":\"Company descriptions including their basic parameters such as their size, location, activities and industry.

It delivers a better experience in typical environments with more predictable performance for advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video; high-density, high-definition collaboration apps; all- wireless offices; and the Internet of Things (IoT). Wi-Fi 6E is Wi-Fi 6 “extended” into the 6-GHz frequency band. AP power AP Power Save mode allows the access point to reduce its power consumption by shutting off radios optimizations during off-hours and weekends – while still being smart enough to reengage all features should they (AP Power Save be needed. This both saves power and reduces the carbon footprint of running a wireless network. mode) ® CleanAir Pro Cisco CleanAir Pro applies Cisco’s industry-leading RF interference detection and classification to the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands. Client steering Client steering helps clients that are 6-GHz capable leave the 5-GHz radio and connect to the 6-GHz radio. Wi-Fi 6E clients are automatically directed to connect to the 6-GHz radio to take advantage of the benefits it offers and free up the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz radios for legacy clients. Uplink/downlink Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the bandwidth into OFDMA smaller frequency allocations called resource units (RUs), which can be assigned to individual clients in both the downlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency. Uplink/downlink Supporting the highest number with 6 spatial streams, multiuser multiple input, multiple output (MU- MU-MIMO MIMO) enables the access points to split spatial streams between client devices to maximize technology throughput. BSS coloring Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set [BSS] coloring) allow the access points and their clients to differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.||\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n[For more details about Catalyst 9163E feature support, see Cisco's Feature Matrix.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/feature-matrix/ap-feature-matrix.html)\\n\\n## Secure infrastructure\\n\\n**Trustworthy systems built with Cisco[®] Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products.**\\nWith the Cisco Catalyst 9163E Access Point, these technologies enable assurance of hardware and software authenticity for\\nsupply chain trust and strong defense against man-in-the-middle attacks that compromise software and firmware.

The**\\\\n\\\\n**Catalyst 9120AX, Catalyst 9124AX, and Catalyst 9130AX staring IOS-XE 17.12.1 release, the maximum scale is reduced to 50 Aps**\\\\n**from 100 APs and 1000 clients from 2000 clients in Prior releases.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nFeature Benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Wi-Fi 6**\\\\n**(802.11ax)**\\\\n**and RF**\\\\n**features**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Cisco RF Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC): On 9100 access points with the RF ASIC, the access point can\\\\n\\\\nperform advanced RF spectrum analysis and delivers features such as Cisco CleanAir, Wireless Intrusion Prevention\\\\nSystem (WIPS), Fast Locate, [*] and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) detection\\\\n( [*]Future).\\\\n\\\\n- Uplink/downlink OFDMA: Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based scheduling splits the\\\\n\\\\nbandwidth into smaller chunks called Resource Units (RUs), which can be allocated to individual clients in both the\\\\ndownlink and uplink directions to reduce overhead and latency.\\\\n\\\\n- MU‑MIMO: Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) enables access points to split spatial streams between\\\\n\\\\nclient devices to maximize throughput.\\\\n\\\\n- BSS coloring: Spatial reuse (also known as Basic Service Set (BSS) coloring) allows the access points and their clients\\\\n\\\\nto differentiate between BSSs, thus permitting more simultaneous transmissions.\\\\n\\\\n- Target Wake Time (TWT): TWT is a new power-saving mode that allows the client to stay asleep and to wake up only at\\\\n\\\\nprescheduled (target) times to exchange data with the access point. This offers significant energy savings for batteryoperated devices, up to 3x to 4x compared to 802.11n and 802.11ac.\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible Radio Assignment: Allows the access points to intelligently determine the operating mode of serving radios\\\\n\\\\nbased on the RF environment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n***Embedded Wireless Controller functionality is not supported on the Wi-Fi 6E Access Points. For more information, please refer to: https://www.**\\\\n\\\\ncisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/q-and-a-c67-743152.html .\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst Access Points is built from the ground up to leverage the new aerodynamic\\\\nlook and smooth finish, RF excellence and next-generation technologies of the Catalyst 9100 series of access points to provide a\\\\nbest-in-class wireless experience without compromise.\\\\n\\\\nCisco DNA support\\\\n\\\\nPairing the EWC-AP with the Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA) allows for a total network transformation.

(1.36 kg)\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9120 Series is approximately 13% lighter and has 25% lower volume than the AP-2800 Series, yet is easy to deploy using the\\\\nsame Cisco Aironet[™] AIR-BRACKET-1 and AIR-BRACKET-2 mounting hardware.\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 mounting options\\\\n\\\\nThere are many different installation options available depending upon the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from\\\\nCisco as well as third-party companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each\\\\nbracket is a zero-dollar ($0) option at the time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the selection default is AIR-APBRACKET-1, which is the most popular for ceiling installations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-APBRACKET-2.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nTwo different types of mounting brackets\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 mounts flush and has the lowest profile. However, if\\\\nthe AP will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, or inside a National Electrical Manufactuers Association (NEMA) enclosure\\\\nor perhaps wall mounted, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in the bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes\\\\nline up with many popular electrical boxes. When mounting the bracket to the ceiling gridwork, some ceiling tiles are recessed. For this\\\\nreason, two different styles of ceiling clips, recessed and flush rails, are available see below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nDifferent clips are available for attaching to ceiling grid work\\\\n\\\\nChannel rail adapters - Cisco part number AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting APs to ceiling channel rails such as the ones shown in Figure 10, an optional channel adapter is used: AIR-CHNLADAPTER. It comes in a two-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip above. Refer to Figures 11 and 12.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall mounting the AP\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be a physical obstacle to the wireless signal; therefore,\\\\nmaintaining 360-degree coverage may be compromised by the wall. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a\\\\n180-degree pattern instead, a directional antenna often referred to as a “patch” antenna may be a better choice assuming the external\\\\nantenna model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall mounting APs with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party companies), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex mounting solutions for 9115, 9117, and 9120 Series access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following third-party companies are recommended for different types of mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberoninc.com/](http://www.oberoninc.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.ventev.com/](http://www.ventev.com/)\\\\n\\\\nIf wall mounted in a non-ceiling orientation the signal may penetrate the floor above and below, causing unintended coverage that could\\\\nresult in additional, needless roaming access when a mobility client (for example, a user with a Wi-Fi phone walks by on an adjacent floor).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.**\\\\n\\\\nCaveats when wall mounting the 9120 Series.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the color of an AP\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a desire to change the color of an AP, rather than painting the AP, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl\\\\ntape or using a colored plastic cover from Oberon.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon third-party option for changing the AP color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nAnother third-party option is a vinyl “skin” such as this one from AccelTex\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i and 9120e are rated for installation in the Plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the AP so that\\\\nnothing can be visible on the ceiling. In some cases, this is preferred for aesthetic reasons, so customers may install the AP above a drop\\\\nceiling. This also may be preferred in high-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing can be visible on\\\\nthe ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hangar accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used\\\\n(Figure 18). The Erico Caddy 512a, the Cooper B-Line BA50a, or similar T-bar Grid can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[www.erico.com/](http://www.erico.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.cooperindustries.com/](http://www.cooperindustries.com/)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of how to hang an AP above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.**\\\\n\\\\nInstalling the AP above ceiling tiles: pick an area clear of obstructions, avoid ceiling clutter\\\\n\\\\n## Areas with high vibration\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is installed using a “side arm”–type mount or other mounting locations where there is a likelihood of high vibration, it is\\\\nrecommended that a padlock or metal pin be used to prevent the AP from vibrating loose from the bracket.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.**\\\\n\\\\nA metal pin or padlock will not deteriorate over time so it is better than a plastic tie\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 and Power over Ethernet (PoE)\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Flexible power options even with limited 802.3af power\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** PoE draw: 9120 Series\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 series Power Power 2.4 GHz 5 GHz Link USB PD Power\\\\nSource Type Radio Radio Speed Draw\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXE / C9120AXP** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 1x1 1x1 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 2x2 N 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE N 2x2 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Ethernet cable recommendation is CAT-6 with a maximum distance of 328 feet (100 meters). Power required at the Power Source\\\\nEquipment (PSE) will be higher depending on the cable length and other environmental issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco has a line of multigigabit products that can easily power these access points\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Improving RF spectrum and performance of the access point client-serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nNext-generation Wi-Fi 6 access points starting with the Catalyst 9120 Series now contain a new radio based on a custom-designed Cisco\\\\nsilicon referred to as an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). This analytics radio enhances the performance of the access point’s\\\\nclient serving radios, as all this deep RF analysis is done on the RF ASIC.\\\\n\\\\nThe function of the Cisco RF ASIC (actually two ASIC chips) one is to analyze a frequency or range of frequencies of interest converting\\\\nthe received RF signal into Quadrature Signals known as I/Q data. This I/Q data is then passed onto a second ASIC that is a dedicated\\\\nbaseband processor for a deep RF analysis such as determining granular changes in the phase and amplitude as well as the modulation\\\\ncharacteristics of the inspected signal.\\\\n\\\\nThe I/Q data is evaluated by the Spectrum Analysis Engine (SAgE), which is custom designed to identify sources of non-Wi-Fi interference,\\\\nat the highest resolution, in the most simple and effective way.\\\\n\\\\nThink of the RF ASIC as a unique piece of hardware that not only contains CleanAir and SAgE, but is also much more advanced and has\\\\nthe capability to support advanced features in the future with software upgrades.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial capabilities of the RF ASIC include all the features of CleanAir/SAgE as well as the ability to sense DFS (Dynamic Frequency\\\\nSelection) events to augment the serving radio’s analysis of DFS for the very best DFS detection in the industry. This greatly improves\\\\nspectrum analysis and provides an always-on “second opinion” of the radio spectrum. This is referred to as dual DFS. In addition, the RF\\\\nASIC also plays a key role in Cisco’s RRM (Radio Resource Management) by providing off-channel analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120i with the Cisco RF ASIC chip\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120i antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\nThe 9120i has one of the most advanced antenna systems available on an access point.\\\\n\\\\nThe main serving radios default in this configuration:\\\\n\\\\n - Dedicated 5-GHz radio tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- (eXclusive OR) known as XOR radio is (defaulted to 2.4 GHz) tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 3 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Dual 5-GHz mode – XOR 2.4 GHz disabled secondary 5-GHz radio tied to dedicated 5-GHz antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the serving radio antennas, there are two other antennas:\\\\n\\\\n - BLE antenna with a gain of 2.1 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - RF ASIC antenna with a gain @ 2.4 GHz of 3 dBi and @ 5 GHz of 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC antenna is connected to a dedicated software-defined radio for spectrum analysis and other advanced RF features. The RF\\\\nASIC antenna is of the same design as the serving radio antennas to provide a similar view of the network as the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 2.4-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 5-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i secondary 5-GHz single-band antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i RF ASIC antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Fi** **24**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system using the DART connector for dual 5 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 27.**\\\\n\\\\nMount antennas away from each other whenever possible\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 4.** List of approved antennas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** These are all dual-band, dual-resonant antennas. Do not use single-band antennas on this product unless you choose to separate\\\\nthe AP into dedicated antennas (for example, dual 5 GHz or 5 GHz on top and 2.4 GHz on the DART). Single-band antennas need to be of\\\\nthe same gain and type as the antennas listed above and may not exceed 6 dBi on the 9120e Series.\\\\n\\\\n[For additional information on Cisco antennas, see the Cisco Antenna Reference Guide at this URL: https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref.](https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 contains a Flexible Radio Architecture (FRA). In a sense, the AP is a tri-band radio as it contains a dedicated 5-GHz\\\\nradio to serve clients and another flexible radio (known as an XOR radio) that can be assigned different functions within the network. The\\\\nflexible radio is similar to the previous XOR radio used in the Cisco Aironet AP-2800 and 3800 Series and is able to be configured to serve\\\\nclients in either 2.4 or 5 GHz or serially scan both 2.4 and 5 GHz on the flexible radio while the main 5-GHz radio serves clients.\\\\n\\\\n## FRA and dual 5-GHz operations\\\\n\\\\nManaging dual 5-GHz cells is one of the most important things that FRA does. There are two modes of operation for dual 5-GHz APs:\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Micro – A large cell with a smaller cell internal, creating double the capacity within the boundaries of a single cell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Macro – Dual independent 5-GHz cells, doubling the coverage of a single traditional dual-band AP. Macro/Macro is only\\\\n\\\\nsupported on 9120e (as external antennas are used to accomplish this).\\\\n\\\\nMacro/Micro is a use case applicable to the Catalyst 9120i models, as the internal antennas are designed to support a cell-within-a-cell\\\\ndeployment. In order for this to be effective, much design is committed to isolation of the two cells, starting at the silicon and ending with\\\\nseparation in antenna polarity and frequency separation.\\\\n\\\\nFRA and Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) will enforce many configuration requirements when operating as dual 5-GHz Macro/Micro:\\\\n\\\\n - Minimum 100-MHz channel separation (frequency diversity)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Micro cell power is restricted to minimum\\\\n\\\\n - Same Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) on each cell\\\\n\\\\nHaving a Macro/Micro cell architecture is attractive because it solves the problem of having one large cell, in which a very diverse client\\\\nexperience exists. Clients closer to the AP are using higher data rates and enjoy a higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) than will clients at the\\\\nedge of the cell. Macro/Micro allows isolation of different clients within the cell that can serve them best and preserves airtime by increasing\\\\noverall efficiency.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\nPicture of a Macro and Micro cell\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA dual 5 GHz capable Catalyst 9120i creating Micro/Macro cells can perform much like two independent 5 GHz access points would using\\\\nall the features and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Catalyst 9120i is operating in dual 5-GHz mode, clients get equal airtime, lower channel utilization rates, faster client-connected\\\\ndata rates, and less retries.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\nSingle 5-GHz channel and dual 5-GHz channel\\\\n\\\\nIn the figure above, (on the left) a single channel cell, say channel 36, has a channel utilization of 60% because all clients are connected to\\\\nthat one channel. To make matters worse, they connect at nonuniform speeds, as the close-in clients connect much faster than the faraway clients.\\\\n\\\\n(Left) Single-channel model – utilization is at 60% on channel 36\\\\n\\\\n(Right) Dual-channel model – channel 36 drops to 20% and channel 108 is at 24%\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the dual-channel model (on the right), by using two channels, the improvements become clear. This results in far less contention\\\\nand less retries and a far better user experience. Note: This feature was first introduced in the 2800/3800 Series, which won Cisco’s\\\\nPioneer Award for innovation in engineering design in 2017. This mode has a very big advantage for reducing channel utilization when\\\\ncombined with Wi-Fi 6 features that help with latency and small packets.\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: Using dual 5GHz, users experience faster throughput, less retries, and a better Wi-Fi experience due to faster data rates and**\\\\nless channel utilization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco CleanAir technology: a custom hardware/software solution.\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome the visibility limitations inherent to standard Wi-Fi chipsets, Cisco has created an integrated solution with patented chips and\\\\nsoftware that has been specifically designed to analyze and classify all RF activity. (More than 25 patents have been issued for this\\\\ntechnology to date.)\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, Cisco has taken the technology behind the Cisco Spectrum Expert analysis tool and integrated it directly into the infrastructure,\\\\nincluding deep integration with a dedicated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and a custom RF ASIC. This is a significant development and\\\\nclearly demonstrates that wireless has transitioned from nice-to-have to business-critical in the enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThe custom solution starts with the Cisco SAgE hardware core, which has been integrated directly into the Cisco RF ASIC custom silicon.\\\\nThe SAgE core handles very compute-intensive operations, such as high-resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pulse detection\\\\noperations. (A pulse is a burst of RF energy in frequency and time.) The SAgE core has a highly granular spectral resolution of 78.125 kHz\\\\n(4x better than the nearest competitive solution and 64x better than most chipsets).\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC provides the AP with an advanced and comprehensive interference analysis, detection, and mitigation system. Essentially,\\\\nthe SAgE core handles a base level of spectrum analysis operations that are so processing intensive that they can be prohibitive to handle\\\\nin real-time software or by the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Comprehensive RF analysis and insight into the spectrum that no other competitor has, clearly identifying interference on a\\\\ndedicated software-defined radio (separate from the client serving radios) so as to not impact access point client-serving performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir clearly identifies the interference using dedicated radio and custom silicon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC and CleanAir chipset augments in the determination of DFS signals enhancing and reducing DFS false alerts so the AP can\\\\nstay on a DFS channel more robustly. In addition to this, the dedicated radio participates in Cisco’s RRM for interference mitigation and\\\\nbest channel selection.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nDFS event (detected by Wi-Fi chipset) is compared to RF ASIC to verify it is indeed a real DFS event\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC is far more advanced than the DFS detection used by the Wi-Fi chipset and serves as a “second set of eyes” into the\\\\nspectrum. The RF ASIC as a dedicated SDR will be enhanced further with new features as future software upgrades are released.\\\\n\\\\n## FastLocate - RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco CMX FastLocate technology enables quick location refresh for connected Wi-Fi clients. Readability Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\\\\nfrom data packets and probe frames, when available, are used for calculating a location. This technology is available with both centrally\\\\nswitched WLANs and Cisco FlexConnect[®] (locally switched WLANs).\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: The Catalyst 9120, with its onboard RF ASIC monitoring radio, enhances location by allowing access points on different clientserving channels to use the RF ASIC to listen to the probes and data packets on the Wi-Fi client of interest regardless of its channel.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nRF ASIC radio can track Wi-Fi clients regardless of the serving channel\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing, warehouses, and factories\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of the material being warehoused. When\\\\nperforming a coverage check (site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels as the material being warehoused can change\\\\nthe RF coverage, creating loss of uniform coverage. Also, try to position the APs as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the\\\\nantennas when possible or practical to do so. If the AP is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, “best case.” When\\\\nconfiguring coverage for aisles, try to use directional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain\\\\nomnidirectional antennas on the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units with integrated antennas as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to\\\\nhave more nulls.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the AP lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example shown in the picture\\\\nbelow.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nAP Placement in warehouse environment\\\\n\\\\n(External dipole “e” series or internal antenna “i” series version could be used)\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting an AP at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to\\\\nthe holes of most electrical boxes. Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 34.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting an AP onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare/clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nIf the Catalyst 9120 is used in a clean room, hospital, or other areas where the need for infection control requires the access point to be\\\\nwiped down with a chemical, it is recommended that a ready-to-use sterilant such as Steris “Spor-Klenz” be used. Unlike some access\\\\npoints, the Catalyst 9120 does not have vent holes in the construction, so it may be wiped down. The plastics have been tested with this\\\\nmaterial.\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant](http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant)\\\\n\\\\nIf the healthcare environment requires metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 35.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStadiums and harsh environments\\\\n\\\\nCustomers wishing to install the AP in harsh environments where it may be exposed to weather, such as sporting areas, stadiums, open\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA enclosure. This varies around the world. For example,\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit AP outdoor NEMA enclosures if the AP is indoors, such as in a freezer or garden area, but may prohibit its\\\\nuse outdoors. This seems to vary with weather radar compliance in different countries and often UNII-1 compliance. Check with your Cisco\\\\naccount team or the communications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 36.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of an AccelTex 12x10x6 NEMA enclosure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberonwireless.com/](http://www.oberonwireless.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.terra-wave.com/](http://www.terra-wave.com/)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-type enclosure, try to have the cables exit out of the bottom of the enclosure so that rain and moisture do not run\\\\ndown the cable into the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating. For example, a black enclosure gets much\\\\nhotter in the sun than a white one. You may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nEducation/schools\\\\n\\\\nSee the deployment guide at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/sch\\\\noolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing APs near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route wiring electrical or Ethernet in the near field (6 to 15 inches) from the antenna. Try\\\\nto refrain from installing the AP in the electrical closet, as the best place for the AP is as close to the users as possible or practical. If you\\\\nmust remote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire/safety regulations for more\\\\non this).\\\\n\\\\nBelow are a few URLs for understanding interference:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Sol\\\\nutions_White_Paper.html\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing APs in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is\\\\nimportant to check the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is\\\\nonly a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of APs rather\\\\nquickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna (or the\\\\nactual AP) on the bottom of the elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing any Wi-Fi equipment inside the elevator cars or shafts, local regulations need to be followed, as many times such\\\\ninstallations are prohibited either for safety reasons or because the building owner or local fire department may prohibit them. Also, it is\\\\ndangerous, and only elevator repair persons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas. When the need for\\\\nexternal antennas is a requirement, again position/use the Catalyst 9120e model.\\\\n\\\\n## WLAN best practices: Catalyst 9120\\\\n\\\\nAccess point antenna placement\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i access point has an advanced antenna system but correct placement of the AP is critical.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 37.**\\\\n\\\\nCoverage is optimized for ceiling placement and radiates omnidirectionally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a Wi Fi device such as an AP and you are going to use another AP in the vicinity on a different channel, it is recommended that\\\\nyou space each AP apart by approximately 6 feet (2 meters). Avoid clustering the APs or the antennas from different APs together, as this\\\\ncould cause degradation in performance. This recommended distance is based on the assumption that both devices operate in the\\\\nunlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB - that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges, for example, frequency-hopping\\\\nlegacy APs or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the AP (think below or above the 2.4 and 5-GHz band), you should\\\\nconsider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference by\\\\ntesting both devices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much, if\\\\nany, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\nWarning\\\\n\\\\nIn order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located at a minimum of 7.9 inches\\\\n(20 centimeters) or more from the body of all persons. See the installation guide under declaration of conformity for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nMixing access points of different models and types\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 is a very advanced access point supporting Wi-Fi 6 features along with unique features such as dual 5 GHz and\\\\nadvanced RF detection using Cisco custom RF ASIC silicon.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, it is not recommended that you mix access point models, sometimes called “salt and pepper,” as it would diminish the\\\\nperformance of the Cisco DNA network, degrading many of our advanced features and perhaps introducing a suboptimal performance.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, if you have a mixture of AP types, it is recommended that you group like access points together (for example, AP-3800s\\\\non, say, one floor and Cisco Catalyst 9120s on another) and refrain from mixing them.\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 general placement guidelines\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding access point installations.\\\\n\\\\n1. Always try to mount the AP as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment (for example, hospitals\\\\n\\\\nhave metal doors, coverage can change when the doors close, old buildings can have metal grid work in the plaster or asbestos). Avoid\\\\nmounting the AP or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area affecting clients.\\\\n\\\\n2. When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1-, 6-, and 11-channel scheme is used as is the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting all\\\\n\\\\nof the APs on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can.\\\\n\\\\n3. Cisco RRM, FRA, and other features can help automate the process.\\\\n\\\\n4. Try to determine which clients are heavily used, checking the coverage with those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might not\\\\n\\\\nhave the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip\\\\n\\\\nVerify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n5. While site surveys are highly recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco RRM is in place, sometimes a limited site\\\\n\\\\nsurvey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. If this is a very challenging environment, such as train connectivity, gas and oil\\\\nverticals, or large hospitals, Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform your\\\\ninstallation. See your Cisco account team for more information.\\\\n\\\\nExample of a channel coverage model spacing nonoverlapping channels\\\\n\\\\nAntenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical or possible, please keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low Loss (LL) and ultralow loss (ULL)\\\\ncables, which have the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nCisco cables carry the part number AIR-CAB (Aironet Cable) and then a length. For example, a 20-ft length of LL cable with RP-TNC\\\\nconnector is Cisco AIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing\\\\nareas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 38.**\\\\n\\\\nWhen drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically 5/8 inch) drill bit\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6 installations and site survey considerations\\\\n\\\\nWh t d h i t ll d t d ? N i th ti t l t WLAN d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nrequirements.\\\\n\\\\n- 1:1 replacement assumes the AP was installed in the best place to meet your current coverage and density goals.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Do you have any coverage issues today that you have not addressed?\\\\n\\\\n- Are there any poorly mounted or suboptimal installations?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Ideally you should have at least 802.3at (30W PoE) available.\\\\n\\\\n - Wi-Fi 6 might help mitigate a poor design, but nothing beats installing it right the first time.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many tools out there to model and perform site surveys. Cisco has recently worked with Ekahau to import Cisco APs and\\\\nantenna models into their application, which also includes the ability to model BLE as well. The Catalyst 9120 AP model will be in the next\\\\nmaintenance release (current is 10.0.1).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 39.**\\\\n\\\\nEkahau offers a site survey and WLAN planner software\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing an active survey for placement, it is always best to have the equipment you plan to deploy. Having the actual model that is\\\\nbeing planned for is not always possible at the time that planning is being done. Cisco spends a great deal of effort to ensure that newermodel AP’s RF coverage matches closely with previous models of APs to reduce the cost of planning and replacing APs. The C9120 is no\\\\ndifferent. The below graphic shows the C9120 as compared with the AP3802i on the same channel and power, as an example only.\\\\nSurveying using an alternate AP is suitable for Bill of Material (BOM) generation or updates to an existing installation. Critical coverage\\\\nshould always be measured using the same model to be certain of the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 40.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of C9120 and AP3802i coverage patterns as measured over the air\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 41.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex site survey battery pack P/N ATS-SSBP-1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nUseful URLs within the guide:\\\\n\\\\n1.

(1.36 kg)\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9120 Series is approximately 13% lighter and has 25% lower volume than the AP-2800 Series, yet is easy to deploy using the\\\\nsame Cisco Aironet[™] AIR-BRACKET-1 and AIR-BRACKET-2 mounting hardware.\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 mounting options\\\\n\\\\nThere are many different installation options available depending upon the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from\\\\nCisco as well as third-party companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each\\\\nbracket is a zero-dollar ($0) option at the time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the selection default is AIR-APBRACKET-1, which is the most popular for ceiling installations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-APBRACKET-2.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nTwo different types of mounting brackets\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 mounts flush and has the lowest profile. However, if\\\\nthe AP will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, or inside a National Electrical Manufactuers Association (NEMA) enclosure\\\\nor perhaps wall mounted, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in the bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes\\\\nline up with many popular electrical boxes. When mounting the bracket to the ceiling gridwork, some ceiling tiles are recessed. For this\\\\nreason, two different styles of ceiling clips, recessed and flush rails, are available see below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nDifferent clips are available for attaching to ceiling grid work\\\\n\\\\nChannel rail adapters - Cisco part number AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting APs to ceiling channel rails such as the ones shown in Figure 10, an optional channel adapter is used: AIR-CHNLADAPTER. It comes in a two-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip above. Refer to Figures 11 and 12.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall mounting the AP\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be a physical obstacle to the wireless signal; therefore,\\\\nmaintaining 360-degree coverage may be compromised by the wall. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a\\\\n180-degree pattern instead, a directional antenna often referred to as a “patch” antenna may be a better choice assuming the external\\\\nantenna model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall mounting APs with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party companies), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex mounting solutions for 9115, 9117, and 9120 Series access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following third-party companies are recommended for different types of mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberoninc.com/](http://www.oberoninc.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.ventev.com/](http://www.ventev.com/)\\\\n\\\\nIf wall mounted in a non-ceiling orientation the signal may penetrate the floor above and below, causing unintended coverage that could\\\\nresult in additional, needless roaming access when a mobility client (for example, a user with a Wi-Fi phone walks by on an adjacent floor).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.**\\\\n\\\\nCaveats when wall mounting the 9120 Series.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the color of an AP\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a desire to change the color of an AP, rather than painting the AP, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl\\\\ntape or using a colored plastic cover from Oberon.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon third-party option for changing the AP color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nAnother third-party option is a vinyl “skin” such as this one from AccelTex\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i and 9120e are rated for installation in the Plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the AP so that\\\\nnothing can be visible on the ceiling. In some cases, this is preferred for aesthetic reasons, so customers may install the AP above a drop\\\\nceiling. This also may be preferred in high-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing can be visible on\\\\nthe ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hangar accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used\\\\n(Figure 18). The Erico Caddy 512a, the Cooper B-Line BA50a, or similar T-bar Grid can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[www.erico.com/](http://www.erico.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.cooperindustries.com/](http://www.cooperindustries.com/)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of how to hang an AP above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.**\\\\n\\\\nInstalling the AP above ceiling tiles: pick an area clear of obstructions, avoid ceiling clutter\\\\n\\\\n## Areas with high vibration\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is installed using a “side arm”–type mount or other mounting locations where there is a likelihood of high vibration, it is\\\\nrecommended that a padlock or metal pin be used to prevent the AP from vibrating loose from the bracket.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.**\\\\n\\\\nA metal pin or padlock will not deteriorate over time so it is better than a plastic tie\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 and Power over Ethernet (PoE)\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Flexible power options even with limited 802.3af power\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** PoE draw: 9120 Series\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 series Power Power 2.4 GHz 5 GHz Link USB PD Power\\\\nSource Type Radio Radio Speed Draw\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXE / C9120AXP** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 1x1 1x1 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 2x2 N 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE N 2x2 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Ethernet cable recommendation is CAT-6 with a maximum distance of 328 feet (100 meters). Power required at the Power Source\\\\nEquipment (PSE) will be higher depending on the cable length and other environmental issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco has a line of multigigabit products that can easily power these access points\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Improving RF spectrum and performance of the access point client-serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nNext-generation Wi-Fi 6 access points starting with the Catalyst 9120 Series now contain a new radio based on a custom-designed Cisco\\\\nsilicon referred to as an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). This analytics radio enhances the performance of the access point’s\\\\nclient serving radios, as all this deep RF analysis is done on the RF ASIC.\\\\n\\\\nThe function of the Cisco RF ASIC (actually two ASIC chips) one is to analyze a frequency or range of frequencies of interest converting\\\\nthe received RF signal into Quadrature Signals known as I/Q data. This I/Q data is then passed onto a second ASIC that is a dedicated\\\\nbaseband processor for a deep RF analysis such as determining granular changes in the phase and amplitude as well as the modulation\\\\ncharacteristics of the inspected signal.\\\\n\\\\nThe I/Q data is evaluated by the Spectrum Analysis Engine (SAgE), which is custom designed to identify sources of non-Wi-Fi interference,\\\\nat the highest resolution, in the most simple and effective way.\\\\n\\\\nThink of the RF ASIC as a unique piece of hardware that not only contains CleanAir and SAgE, but is also much more advanced and has\\\\nthe capability to support advanced features in the future with software upgrades.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial capabilities of the RF ASIC include all the features of CleanAir/SAgE as well as the ability to sense DFS (Dynamic Frequency\\\\nSelection) events to augment the serving radio’s analysis of DFS for the very best DFS detection in the industry. This greatly improves\\\\nspectrum analysis and provides an always-on “second opinion” of the radio spectrum. This is referred to as dual DFS. In addition, the RF\\\\nASIC also plays a key role in Cisco’s RRM (Radio Resource Management) by providing off-channel analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120i with the Cisco RF ASIC chip\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120i antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\nThe 9120i has one of the most advanced antenna systems available on an access point.\\\\n\\\\nThe main serving radios default in this configuration:\\\\n\\\\n - Dedicated 5-GHz radio tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- (eXclusive OR) known as XOR radio is (defaulted to 2.4 GHz) tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 3 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Dual 5-GHz mode – XOR 2.4 GHz disabled secondary 5-GHz radio tied to dedicated 5-GHz antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the serving radio antennas, there are two other antennas:\\\\n\\\\n - BLE antenna with a gain of 2.1 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - RF ASIC antenna with a gain @ 2.4 GHz of 3 dBi and @ 5 GHz of 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC antenna is connected to a dedicated software-defined radio for spectrum analysis and other advanced RF features.

Do not use single-band antennas on this product unless you choose to separate\\\\nthe AP into dedicated antennas (for example, dual 5 GHz or 5 GHz on top and 2.4 GHz on the DART). Single-band antennas need to be of\\\\nthe same gain and type as the antennas listed above and may not exceed 6 dBi on the 9120e Series.\\\\n\\\\n[For additional information on Cisco antennas, see the Cisco Antenna Reference Guide at this URL: https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref.](https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 contains a Flexible Radio Architecture (FRA). In a sense, the AP is a tri-band radio as it contains a dedicated 5-GHz\\\\nradio to serve clients and another flexible radio (known as an XOR radio) that can be assigned different functions within the network. The\\\\nflexible radio is similar to the previous XOR radio used in the Cisco Aironet AP-2800 and 3800 Series and is able to be configured to serve\\\\nclients in either 2.4 or 5 GHz or serially scan both 2.4 and 5 GHz on the flexible radio while the main 5-GHz radio serves clients.\\\\n\\\\n## FRA and dual 5-GHz operations\\\\n\\\\nManaging dual 5-GHz cells is one of the most important things that FRA does. There are two modes of operation for dual 5-GHz APs:\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Micro – A large cell with a smaller cell internal, creating double the capacity within the boundaries of a single cell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Macro – Dual independent 5-GHz cells, doubling the coverage of a single traditional dual-band AP. Macro/Macro is only\\\\n\\\\nsupported on 9120e (as external antennas are used to accomplish this).\\\\n\\\\nMacro/Micro is a use case applicable to the Catalyst 9120i models, as the internal antennas are designed to support a cell-within-a-cell\\\\ndeployment. In order for this to be effective, much design is committed to isolation of the two cells, starting at the silicon and ending with\\\\nseparation in antenna polarity and frequency separation.\\\\n\\\\nFRA and Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) will enforce many configuration requirements when operating as dual 5-GHz Macro/Micro:\\\\n\\\\n - Minimum 100-MHz channel separation (frequency diversity)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Micro cell power is restricted to minimum\\\\n\\\\n - Same Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) on each cell\\\\n\\\\nHaving a Macro/Micro cell architecture is attractive because it solves the problem of having one large cell, in which a very diverse client\\\\nexperience exists. Clients closer to the AP are using higher data rates and enjoy a higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) than will clients at the\\\\nedge of the cell. Macro/Micro allows isolation of different clients within the cell that can serve them best and preserves airtime by increasing\\\\noverall efficiency.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\nPicture of a Macro and Micro cell\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA dual 5 GHz capable Catalyst 9120i creating Micro/Macro cells can perform much like two independent 5 GHz access points would using\\\\nall the features and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Catalyst 9120i is operating in dual 5-GHz mode, clients get equal airtime, lower channel utilization rates, faster client-connected\\\\ndata rates, and less retries.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\nSingle 5-GHz channel and dual 5-GHz channel\\\\n\\\\nIn the figure above, (on the left) a single channel cell, say channel 36, has a channel utilization of 60% because all clients are connected to\\\\nthat one channel. To make matters worse, they connect at nonuniform speeds, as the close-in clients connect much faster than the faraway clients.\\\\n\\\\n(Left) Single-channel model – utilization is at 60% on channel 36\\\\n\\\\n(Right) Dual-channel model – channel 36 drops to 20% and channel 108 is at 24%\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the dual-channel model (on the right), by using two channels, the improvements become clear. This results in far less contention\\\\nand less retries and a far better user experience. Note: This feature was first introduced in the 2800/3800 Series, which won Cisco’s\\\\nPioneer Award for innovation in engineering design in 2017. This mode has a very big advantage for reducing channel utilization when\\\\ncombined with Wi-Fi 6 features that help with latency and small packets.\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: Using dual 5GHz, users experience faster throughput, less retries, and a better Wi-Fi experience due to faster data rates and**\\\\nless channel utilization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco CleanAir technology: a custom hardware/software solution.\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome the visibility limitations inherent to standard Wi-Fi chipsets, Cisco has created an integrated solution with patented chips and\\\\nsoftware that has been specifically designed to analyze and classify all RF activity. (More than 25 patents have been issued for this\\\\ntechnology to date.)\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, Cisco has taken the technology behind the Cisco Spectrum Expert analysis tool and integrated it directly into the infrastructure,\\\\nincluding deep integration with a dedicated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and a custom RF ASIC. This is a significant development and\\\\nclearly demonstrates that wireless has transitioned from nice-to-have to business-critical in the enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThe custom solution starts with the Cisco SAgE hardware core, which has been integrated directly into the Cisco RF ASIC custom silicon.\\\\nThe SAgE core handles very compute-intensive operations, such as high-resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pulse detection\\\\noperations. (A pulse is a burst of RF energy in frequency and time.) The SAgE core has a highly granular spectral resolution of 78.125 kHz\\\\n(4x better than the nearest competitive solution and 64x better than most chipsets).\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC provides the AP with an advanced and comprehensive interference analysis, detection, and mitigation system. Essentially,\\\\nthe SAgE core handles a base level of spectrum analysis operations that are so processing intensive that they can be prohibitive to handle\\\\nin real-time software or by the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Comprehensive RF analysis and insight into the spectrum that no other competitor has, clearly identifying interference on a\\\\ndedicated software-defined radio (separate from the client serving radios) so as to not impact access point client-serving performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir clearly identifies the interference using dedicated radio and custom silicon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC and CleanAir chipset augments in the determination of DFS signals enhancing and reducing DFS false alerts so the AP can\\\\nstay on a DFS channel more robustly. In addition to this, the dedicated radio participates in Cisco’s RRM for interference mitigation and\\\\nbest channel selection.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nDFS event (detected by Wi-Fi chipset) is compared to RF ASIC to verify it is indeed a real DFS event\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC is far more advanced than the DFS detection used by the Wi-Fi chipset and serves as a “second set of eyes” into the\\\\nspectrum. The RF ASIC as a dedicated SDR will be enhanced further with new features as future software upgrades are released.\\\\n\\\\n## FastLocate - RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco CMX FastLocate technology enables quick location refresh for connected Wi-Fi clients. Readability Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\\\\nfrom data packets and probe frames, when available, are used for calculating a location. This technology is available with both centrally\\\\nswitched WLANs and Cisco FlexConnect[®] (locally switched WLANs).\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: The Catalyst 9120, with its onboard RF ASIC monitoring radio, enhances location by allowing access points on different clientserving channels to use the RF ASIC to listen to the probes and data packets on the Wi-Fi client of interest regardless of its channel.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nRF ASIC radio can track Wi-Fi clients regardless of the serving channel\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing, warehouses, and factories\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of the material being warehoused. When\\\\nperforming a coverage check (site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels as the material being warehoused can change\\\\nthe RF coverage, creating loss of uniform coverage. Also, try to position the APs as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the\\\\nantennas when possible or practical to do so. If the AP is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, “best case.” When\\\\nconfiguring coverage for aisles, try to use directional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain\\\\nomnidirectional antennas on the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units with integrated antennas as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to\\\\nhave more nulls.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the AP lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example shown in the picture\\\\nbelow.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nAP Placement in warehouse environment\\\\n\\\\n(External dipole “e” series or internal antenna “i” series version could be used)\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting an AP at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to\\\\nthe holes of most electrical boxes. Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 34.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting an AP onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare/clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nIf the Catalyst 9120 is used in a clean room, hospital, or other areas where the need for infection control requires the access point to be\\\\nwiped down with a chemical, it is recommended that a ready-to-use sterilant such as Steris “Spor-Klenz” be used. Unlike some access\\\\npoints, the Catalyst 9120 does not have vent holes in the construction, so it may be wiped down. The plastics have been tested with this\\\\nmaterial.\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant](http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant)\\\\n\\\\nIf the healthcare environment requires metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 35.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStadiums and harsh environments\\\\n\\\\nCustomers wishing to install the AP in harsh environments where it may be exposed to weather, such as sporting areas, stadiums, open\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA enclosure. This varies around the world. For example,\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit AP outdoor NEMA enclosures if the AP is indoors, such as in a freezer or garden area, but may prohibit its\\\\nuse outdoors. This seems to vary with weather radar compliance in different countries and often UNII-1 compliance. Check with your Cisco\\\\naccount team or the communications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 36.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of an AccelTex 12x10x6 NEMA enclosure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberonwireless.com/](http://www.oberonwireless.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.terra-wave.com/](http://www.terra-wave.com/)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-type enclosure, try to have the cables exit out of the bottom of the enclosure so that rain and moisture do not run\\\\ndown the cable into the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating. For example, a black enclosure gets much\\\\nhotter in the sun than a white one. You may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nEducation/schools\\\\n\\\\nSee the deployment guide at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/sch\\\\noolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing APs near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route wiring electrical or Ethernet in the near field (6 to 15 inches) from the antenna. Try\\\\nto refrain from installing the AP in the electrical closet, as the best place for the AP is as close to the users as possible or practical. If you\\\\nmust remote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire/safety regulations for more\\\\non this).\\\\n\\\\nBelow are a few URLs for understanding interference:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Sol\\\\nutions_White_Paper.html\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing APs in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is\\\\nimportant to check the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is\\\\nonly a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of APs rather\\\\nquickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna (or the\\\\nactual AP) on the bottom of the elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing any Wi-Fi equipment inside the elevator cars or shafts, local regulations need to be followed, as many times such\\\\ninstallations are prohibited either for safety reasons or because the building owner or local fire department may prohibit them. Also, it is\\\\ndangerous, and only elevator repair persons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas. When the need for\\\\nexternal antennas is a requirement, again position/use the Catalyst 9120e model.\\\\n\\\\n## WLAN best practices: Catalyst 9120\\\\n\\\\nAccess point antenna placement\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i access point has an advanced antenna system but correct placement of the AP is critical.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 37.**\\\\n\\\\nCoverage is optimized for ceiling placement and radiates omnidirectionally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a Wi Fi device such as an AP and you are going to use another AP in the vicinity on a different channel, it is recommended that\\\\nyou space each AP apart by approximately 6 feet (2 meters). Avoid clustering the APs or the antennas from different APs together, as this\\\\ncould cause degradation in performance. This recommended distance is based on the assumption that both devices operate in the\\\\nunlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB - that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges, for example, frequency-hopping\\\\nlegacy APs or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the AP (think below or above the 2.4 and 5-GHz band), you should\\\\nconsider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference by\\\\ntesting both devices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much, if\\\\nany, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\nWarning\\\\n\\\\nIn order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located at a minimum of 7.9 inches\\\\n(20 centimeters) or more from the body of all persons. See the installation guide under declaration of conformity for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nMixing access points of different models and types\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 is a very advanced access point supporting Wi-Fi 6 features along with unique features such as dual 5 GHz and\\\\nadvanced RF detection using Cisco custom RF ASIC silicon.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, it is not recommended that you mix access point models, sometimes called “salt and pepper,” as it would diminish the\\\\nperformance of the Cisco DNA network, degrading many of our advanced features and perhaps introducing a suboptimal performance.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, if you have a mixture of AP types, it is recommended that you group like access points together (for example, AP-3800s\\\\non, say, one floor and Cisco Catalyst 9120s on another) and refrain from mixing them.\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 general placement guidelines\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding access point installations.\\\\n\\\\n1. Always try to mount the AP as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment (for example, hospitals\\\\n\\\\nhave metal doors, coverage can change when the doors close, old buildings can have metal grid work in the plaster or asbestos). Avoid\\\\nmounting the AP or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area affecting clients.\\\\n\\\\n2. When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1-, 6-, and 11-channel scheme is used as is the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting all\\\\n\\\\nof the APs on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can.\\\\n\\\\n3. Cisco RRM, FRA, and other features can help automate the process.\\\\n\\\\n4. Try to determine which clients are heavily used, checking the coverage with those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might not\\\\n\\\\nhave the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip\\\\n\\\\nVerify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n5. While site surveys are highly recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco RRM is in place, sometimes a limited site\\\\n\\\\nsurvey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. If this is a very challenging environment, such as train connectivity, gas and oil\\\\nverticals, or large hospitals, Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform your\\\\ninstallation. See your Cisco account team for more information.\\\\n\\\\nExample of a channel coverage model spacing nonoverlapping channels\\\\n\\\\nAntenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical or possible, please keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low Loss (LL) and ultralow loss (ULL)\\\\ncables, which have the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nCisco cables carry the part number AIR-CAB (Aironet Cable) and then a length. For example, a 20-ft length of LL cable with RP-TNC\\\\nconnector is Cisco AIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing\\\\nareas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 38.**\\\\n\\\\nWhen drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically 5/8 inch) drill bit\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6 installations and site survey considerations\\\\n\\\\nWh t d h i t ll d t d ? N i th ti t l t WLAN d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nrequirements.\\\\n\\\\n- 1:1 replacement assumes the AP was installed in the best place to meet your current coverage and density goals.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Do you have any coverage issues today that you have not addressed?\\\\n\\\\n- Are there any poorly mounted or suboptimal installations?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Ideally you should have at least 802.3at (30W PoE) available.\\\\n\\\\n - Wi-Fi 6 might help mitigate a poor design, but nothing beats installing it right the first time.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many tools out there to model and perform site surveys. Cisco has recently worked with Ekahau to import Cisco APs and\\\\nantenna models into their application, which also includes the ability to model BLE as well. The Catalyst 9120 AP model will be in the next\\\\nmaintenance release (current is 10.0.1).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 39.**\\\\n\\\\nEkahau offers a site survey and WLAN planner software\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing an active survey for placement, it is always best to have the equipment you plan to deploy. Having the actual model that is\\\\nbeing planned for is not always possible at the time that planning is being done. Cisco spends a great deal of effort to ensure that newermodel AP’s RF coverage matches closely with previous models of APs to reduce the cost of planning and replacing APs. The C9120 is no\\\\ndifferent. The below graphic shows the C9120 as compared with the AP3802i on the same channel and power, as an example only.\\\\nSurveying using an alternate AP is suitable for Bill of Material (BOM) generation or updates to an existing installation. Critical coverage\\\\nshould always be measured using the same model to be certain of the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 40.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of C9120 and AP3802i coverage patterns as measured over the air\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 41.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex site survey battery pack P/N ATS-SSBP-1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nUseful URLs within the guide:\\\\n\\\\n1.

(1.36 kg)\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The 9120 Series is approximately 13% lighter and has 25% lower volume than the AP-2800 Series, yet is easy to deploy using the\\\\nsame Cisco Aironet[™] AIR-BRACKET-1 and AIR-BRACKET-2 mounting hardware.\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 mounting options\\\\n\\\\nThere are many different installation options available depending upon the requirements of the customer. Brackets are available from\\\\nCisco as well as third-party companies. During the ordering process, the customer may choose one of two brackets (but not both). Each\\\\nbracket is a zero-dollar ($0) option at the time of configuration. If the customer does not choose a bracket, the selection default is AIR-APBRACKET-1, which is the most popular for ceiling installations. The other choice is a universal bracket that carries part number AIR-APBRACKET-2.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 5.**\\\\n\\\\nTwo different types of mounting brackets\\\\n\\\\nIf the AP will be mounted directly to a ceiling on the gridwork, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-1 mounts flush and has the lowest profile. However, if\\\\nthe AP will be mounted to an electrical box or other wiring fixture, or inside a National Electrical Manufactuers Association (NEMA) enclosure\\\\nor perhaps wall mounted, then AIR-AP-BRACKET-2 is a better choice. The extra space in the bracket allows for wiring, and the extra holes\\\\nline up with many popular electrical boxes. When mounting the bracket to the ceiling gridwork, some ceiling tiles are recessed. For this\\\\nreason, two different styles of ceiling clips, recessed and flush rails, are available see below.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 6.**\\\\n\\\\nDifferent clips are available for attaching to ceiling grid work\\\\n\\\\nChannel rail adapters - Cisco part number AIR-CHNL-ADAPTER\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting APs to ceiling channel rails such as the ones shown in Figure 10, an optional channel adapter is used: AIR-CHNLADAPTER. It comes in a two-pack and attaches to the ceiling grid clip above. Refer to Figures 11 and 12.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 7.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of channel rails\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 8.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER (left) slides onto the rails\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 9.**\\\\n\\\\nAIR-CHNL-ADAPTER mounted to rail clip (left) and finished installation (right)\\\\n\\\\nWall mounting the AP\\\\n\\\\nWhen wall mounting is desired, the installer should understand that walls can be a physical obstacle to the wireless signal; therefore,\\\\nmaintaining 360-degree coverage may be compromised by the wall. If the wall is an outside wall and/or the goal is to send the signal in a\\\\n180-degree pattern instead, a directional antenna often referred to as a “patch” antenna may be a better choice assuming the external\\\\nantenna model is used.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid wall mounting APs with internal antennas unless you use an optional right-angle mount (available from third-party companies), as the\\\\ninternal antenna model was designed to mount to a ceiling to provide 360-degree coverage.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 10.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex mounting solutions for 9115, 9117, and 9120 Series access points\\\\n\\\\nThe following third-party companies are recommended for different types of mounting solutions.\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberoninc.com/](http://www.oberoninc.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.ventev.com/](http://www.ventev.com/)\\\\n\\\\nIf wall mounted in a non-ceiling orientation the signal may penetrate the floor above and below, causing unintended coverage that could\\\\nresult in additional, needless roaming access when a mobility client (for example, a user with a Wi-Fi phone walks by on an adjacent floor).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 11.**\\\\n\\\\nCaveats when wall mounting the 9120 Series.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the color of an AP\\\\n\\\\nIf there is a desire to change the color of an AP, rather than painting the AP, which would void the warranty, consider using colored vinyl\\\\ntape or using a colored plastic cover from Oberon.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 12.**\\\\n\\\\nOberon third-party option for changing the AP color, adding a custom logo, or hiding the LED\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 13.**\\\\n\\\\nAnother third-party option is a vinyl “skin” such as this one from AccelTex\\\\n\\\\nAbove the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i and 9120e are rated for installation in the Plenum area (UL-2043). Many customers prefer to locate the AP so that\\\\nnothing can be visible on the ceiling. In some cases, this is preferred for aesthetic reasons, so customers may install the AP above a drop\\\\nceiling. This also may be preferred in high-theft areas such as classrooms or in areas where policy dictates that nothing can be visible on\\\\nthe ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nWhen this is a hard requirement, optional T-bar hangar accessories from third-party companies such as Erico and Cooper can be used\\\\n(Figure 18). The Erico Caddy 512a, the Cooper B-Line BA50a, or similar T-bar Grid can be used.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, see:\\\\n\\\\n[www.erico.com/](http://www.erico.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.cooperindustries.com/](http://www.cooperindustries.com/)\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 14.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of how to hang an AP above the ceiling tiles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 15.**\\\\n\\\\nInstalling the AP above ceiling tiles: pick an area clear of obstructions, avoid ceiling clutter\\\\n\\\\n## Areas with high vibration\\\\n\\\\nIf the access point is installed using a “side arm”–type mount or other mounting locations where there is a likelihood of high vibration, it is\\\\nrecommended that a padlock or metal pin be used to prevent the AP from vibrating loose from the bracket.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 16.**\\\\n\\\\nA metal pin or padlock will not deteriorate over time so it is better than a plastic tie\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120 and Power over Ethernet (PoE)\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Flexible power options even with limited 802.3af power\\\\n\\\\n**Table 3.** PoE draw: 9120 Series\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 series Power Power 2.4 GHz 5 GHz Link USB PD Power\\\\nSource Type Radio Radio Speed Draw\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXE / C9120AXP** 802.3at POE 4x4 4x4 2.5G Y 25.5 W\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 1x1 1x1 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE 2x2 N 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**C9120AXI / C9120AXE /** 802.3af POE N 2x2 1G N 13.4 W\\\\n**C9120AXP**\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Ethernet cable recommendation is CAT-6 with a maximum distance of 328 feet (100 meters). Power required at the Power Source\\\\nEquipment (PSE) will be higher depending on the cable length and other environmental issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 17.**\\\\n\\\\nCisco has a line of multigigabit products that can easily power these access points\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Improving RF spectrum and performance of the access point client-serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nNext-generation Wi-Fi 6 access points starting with the Catalyst 9120 Series now contain a new radio based on a custom-designed Cisco\\\\nsilicon referred to as an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). This analytics radio enhances the performance of the access point’s\\\\nclient serving radios, as all this deep RF analysis is done on the RF ASIC.\\\\n\\\\nThe function of the Cisco RF ASIC (actually two ASIC chips) one is to analyze a frequency or range of frequencies of interest converting\\\\nthe received RF signal into Quadrature Signals known as I/Q data. This I/Q data is then passed onto a second ASIC that is a dedicated\\\\nbaseband processor for a deep RF analysis such as determining granular changes in the phase and amplitude as well as the modulation\\\\ncharacteristics of the inspected signal.\\\\n\\\\nThe I/Q data is evaluated by the Spectrum Analysis Engine (SAgE), which is custom designed to identify sources of non-Wi-Fi interference,\\\\nat the highest resolution, in the most simple and effective way.\\\\n\\\\nThink of the RF ASIC as a unique piece of hardware that not only contains CleanAir and SAgE, but is also much more advanced and has\\\\nthe capability to support advanced features in the future with software upgrades.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial capabilities of the RF ASIC include all the features of CleanAir/SAgE as well as the ability to sense DFS (Dynamic Frequency\\\\nSelection) events to augment the serving radio’s analysis of DFS for the very best DFS detection in the industry. This greatly improves\\\\nspectrum analysis and provides an always-on “second opinion” of the radio spectrum. This is referred to as dual DFS. In addition, the RF\\\\nASIC also plays a key role in Cisco’s RRM (Radio Resource Management) by providing off-channel analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 18.**\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120i with the Cisco RF ASIC chip\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120i antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 19.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i internal antenna system\\\\n\\\\nThe 9120i has one of the most advanced antenna systems available on an access point.\\\\n\\\\nThe main serving radios default in this configuration:\\\\n\\\\n - Dedicated 5-GHz radio tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- (eXclusive OR) known as XOR radio is (defaulted to 2.4 GHz) tied to the dual-band client serving antennas @ 3 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Dual 5-GHz mode – XOR 2.4 GHz disabled secondary 5-GHz radio tied to dedicated 5-GHz antennas @ 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the serving radio antennas, there are two other antennas:\\\\n\\\\n - BLE antenna with a gain of 2.1 dBi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - RF ASIC antenna with a gain @ 2.4 GHz of 3 dBi and @ 5 GHz of 4 dBi\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC antenna is connected to a dedicated software-defined radio for spectrum analysis and other advanced RF features. The RF\\\\nASIC antenna is of the same design as the serving radio antennas to provide a similar view of the network as the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 20.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 2.4-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 21.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i 5-GHz antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 22.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i secondary 5-GHz single-band antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 23.**\\\\n\\\\n9120i RF ASIC antenna patterns\\\\n\\\\n**Fi** **24**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n## Catalyst 9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 25.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 26.**\\\\n\\\\n9120e antenna system using the DART connector for dual 5 GHz\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 27.**\\\\n\\\\nMount antennas away from each other whenever possible\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Table 4.** List of approved antennas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** These are all dual-band, dual-resonant antennas. Do not use single-band antennas on this product unless you choose to separate\\\\nthe AP into dedicated antennas (for example, dual 5 GHz or 5 GHz on top and 2.4 GHz on the DART). Single-band antennas need to be of\\\\nthe same gain and type as the antennas listed above and may not exceed 6 dBi on the 9120e Series.\\\\n\\\\n[For additional information on Cisco antennas, see the Cisco Antenna Reference Guide at this URL: https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref.](https://www.cisco.com/go/antenna-ref)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 contains a Flexible Radio Architecture (FRA). In a sense, the AP is a tri-band radio as it contains a dedicated 5-GHz\\\\nradio to serve clients and another flexible radio (known as an XOR radio) that can be assigned different functions within the network. The\\\\nflexible radio is similar to the previous XOR radio used in the Cisco Aironet AP-2800 and 3800 Series and is able to be configured to serve\\\\nclients in either 2.4 or 5 GHz or serially scan both 2.4 and 5 GHz on the flexible radio while the main 5-GHz radio serves clients.\\\\n\\\\n## FRA and dual 5-GHz operations\\\\n\\\\nManaging dual 5-GHz cells is one of the most important things that FRA does. There are two modes of operation for dual 5-GHz APs:\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Micro – A large cell with a smaller cell internal, creating double the capacity within the boundaries of a single cell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Macro/Macro – Dual independent 5-GHz cells, doubling the coverage of a single traditional dual-band AP. Macro/Macro is only\\\\n\\\\nsupported on 9120e (as external antennas are used to accomplish this).\\\\n\\\\nMacro/Micro is a use case applicable to the Catalyst 9120i models, as the internal antennas are designed to support a cell-within-a-cell\\\\ndeployment. In order for this to be effective, much design is committed to isolation of the two cells, starting at the silicon and ending with\\\\nseparation in antenna polarity and frequency separation.\\\\n\\\\nFRA and Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) will enforce many configuration requirements when operating as dual 5-GHz Macro/Micro:\\\\n\\\\n - Minimum 100-MHz channel separation (frequency diversity)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Micro cell power is restricted to minimum\\\\n\\\\n - Same Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) on each cell\\\\n\\\\nHaving a Macro/Micro cell architecture is attractive because it solves the problem of having one large cell, in which a very diverse client\\\\nexperience exists. Clients closer to the AP are using higher data rates and enjoy a higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) than will clients at the\\\\nedge of the cell. Macro/Micro allows isolation of different clients within the cell that can serve them best and preserves airtime by increasing\\\\noverall efficiency.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 28.**\\\\n\\\\nPicture of a Macro and Micro cell\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nA dual 5 GHz capable Catalyst 9120i creating Micro/Macro cells can perform much like two independent 5 GHz access points would using\\\\nall the features and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Catalyst 9120i is operating in dual 5-GHz mode, clients get equal airtime, lower channel utilization rates, faster client-connected\\\\ndata rates, and less retries.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 29.**\\\\n\\\\nSingle 5-GHz channel and dual 5-GHz channel\\\\n\\\\nIn the figure above, (on the left) a single channel cell, say channel 36, has a channel utilization of 60% because all clients are connected to\\\\nthat one channel. To make matters worse, they connect at nonuniform speeds, as the close-in clients connect much faster than the faraway clients.\\\\n\\\\n(Left) Single-channel model – utilization is at 60% on channel 36\\\\n\\\\n(Right) Dual-channel model – channel 36 drops to 20% and channel 108 is at 24%\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the dual-channel model (on the right), by using two channels, the improvements become clear. This results in far less contention\\\\nand less retries and a far better user experience. Note: This feature was first introduced in the 2800/3800 Series, which won Cisco’s\\\\nPioneer Award for innovation in engineering design in 2017. This mode has a very big advantage for reducing channel utilization when\\\\ncombined with Wi-Fi 6 features that help with latency and small packets.\\\\n\\\\n**Take-away: Using dual 5GHz, users experience faster throughput, less retries, and a better Wi-Fi experience due to faster data rates and**\\\\nless channel utilization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nCisco CleanAir technology: a custom hardware/software solution.\\\\n\\\\nTo overcome the visibility limitations inherent to standard Wi-Fi chipsets, Cisco has created an integrated solution with patented chips and\\\\nsoftware that has been specifically designed to analyze and classify all RF activity. (More than 25 patents have been issued for this\\\\ntechnology to date.)\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, Cisco has taken the technology behind the Cisco Spectrum Expert analysis tool and integrated it directly into the infrastructure,\\\\nincluding deep integration with a dedicated Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and a custom RF ASIC. This is a significant development and\\\\nclearly demonstrates that wireless has transitioned from nice-to-have to business-critical in the enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThe custom solution starts with the Cisco SAgE hardware core, which has been integrated directly into the Cisco RF ASIC custom silicon.\\\\nThe SAgE core handles very compute-intensive operations, such as high-resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and pulse detection\\\\noperations. (A pulse is a burst of RF energy in frequency and time.) The SAgE core has a highly granular spectral resolution of 78.125 kHz\\\\n(4x better than the nearest competitive solution and 64x better than most chipsets).\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC provides the AP with an advanced and comprehensive interference analysis, detection, and mitigation system. Essentially,\\\\nthe SAgE core handles a base level of spectrum analysis operations that are so processing intensive that they can be prohibitive to handle\\\\nin real-time software or by the serving radios.\\\\n\\\\nBenefit – Comprehensive RF analysis and insight into the spectrum that no other competitor has, clearly identifying interference on a\\\\ndedicated software-defined radio (separate from the client serving radios) so as to not impact access point client-serving performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 30.**\\\\n\\\\nCleanAir clearly identifies the interference using dedicated radio and custom silicon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC and CleanAir chipset augments in the determination of DFS signals enhancing and reducing DFS false alerts so the AP can\\\\nstay on a DFS channel more robustly. In addition to this, the dedicated radio participates in Cisco’s RRM for interference mitigation and\\\\nbest channel selection.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 31.**\\\\n\\\\nDFS event (detected by Wi-Fi chipset) is compared to RF ASIC to verify it is indeed a real DFS event\\\\n\\\\nThe RF ASIC is far more advanced than the DFS detection used by the Wi-Fi chipset and serves as a “second set of eyes” into the\\\\nspectrum. The RF ASIC as a dedicated SDR will be enhanced further with new features as future software upgrades are released.\\\\n\\\\n## FastLocate - RF ASIC\\\\n\\\\nCisco CMX FastLocate technology enables quick location refresh for connected Wi-Fi clients. Readability Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\\\\nfrom data packets and probe frames, when available, are used for calculating a location. This technology is available with both centrally\\\\nswitched WLANs and Cisco FlexConnect[®] (locally switched WLANs).\\\\n\\\\nBenefit: The Catalyst 9120, with its onboard RF ASIC monitoring radio, enhances location by allowing access points on different clientserving channels to use the RF ASIC to listen to the probes and data packets on the Wi-Fi client of interest regardless of its channel.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 32.**\\\\n\\\\nRF ASIC radio can track Wi-Fi clients regardless of the serving channel\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing, warehouses, and factories\\\\n\\\\nWarehouse installations are often difficult because of the very high ceilings and the clutter of the material being warehoused. When\\\\nperforming a coverage check (site survey), always check the coverage at “full stock” levels as the material being warehoused can change\\\\nthe RF coverage, creating loss of uniform coverage. Also, try to position the APs as close to the users as possible, perhaps lowering the\\\\nantennas when possible or practical to do so. If the AP is 30 feet in the air, that is 30 feet farther the signal has to go, “best case.” When\\\\nconfiguring coverage for aisles, try to use directional (patch) antennas on the wall and shoot down the aisles, or use low-gain\\\\nomnidirectional antennas on the ceiling (such as dipoles) or units with integrated antennas as high-gain omnidirectional antennas tend to\\\\nhave more nulls.\\\\n\\\\nAnother option is to mount the AP lower using pipe and electrical box mounting techniques. Refer to the example shown in the picture\\\\nbelow.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 33.**\\\\n\\\\nAP Placement in warehouse environment\\\\n\\\\n(External dipole “e” series or internal antenna “i” series version could be used)\\\\n\\\\nWhen mounting an AP at the end of a pipe or electrical conduit box, use the universal bracket Cisco AIR-AP-BRACKET-2, as it will mate to\\\\nthe holes of most electrical boxes. Conduit and adapters can be purchased at most electrical or home repair centers.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 34.**\\\\n\\\\nMounting an AP onto an electrical conduit box (ceiling T-bar or conduit)\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare/clean rooms\\\\n\\\\nIf the Catalyst 9120 is used in a clean room, hospital, or other areas where the need for infection control requires the access point to be\\\\nwiped down with a chemical, it is recommended that a ready-to-use sterilant such as Steris “Spor-Klenz” be used. Unlike some access\\\\npoints, the Catalyst 9120 does not have vent holes in the construction, so it may be wiped down. The plastics have been tested with this\\\\nmaterial.\\\\n\\\\n[http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant](http://www.sterislifesciences.com/products/surface-disinfectants/sporicide-cleaners-and-sterilant/spor-klenz-ready-to-use-cold-sterilant)\\\\n\\\\nIf the healthcare environment requires metal ceilings or areas where tile is not practical, a metal enclosure from Oberon or AccelTex can be\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 35.**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nStadiums and harsh environments\\\\n\\\\nCustomers wishing to install the AP in harsh environments where it may be exposed to weather, such as sporting areas, stadiums, open\\\\ngarden areas, or warehouse freezers, may wish to use a NEMA-type enclosure.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Some access points may not be certified for outdoor deployments in a NEMA enclosure. This varies around the world. For example,\\\\nsome regulatory agencies permit AP outdoor NEMA enclosures if the AP is indoors, such as in a freezer or garden area, but may prohibit its\\\\nuse outdoors. This seems to vary with weather radar compliance in different countries and often UNII-1 compliance. Check with your Cisco\\\\naccount team or the communications regulatory agency that has jurisdiction in your part of the world.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 36.**\\\\n\\\\nExample of an AccelTex 12x10x6 NEMA enclosure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n[www.oberonwireless.com/](http://www.oberonwireless.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.acceltex.com/](http://www.acceltex.com/)\\\\n\\\\n[www.terra-wave.com/](http://www.terra-wave.com/)\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a NEMA-type enclosure, try to have the cables exit out of the bottom of the enclosure so that rain and moisture do not run\\\\ndown the cable into the enclosure. Also, the color of the enclosure may affect the heat rating. For example, a black enclosure gets much\\\\nhotter in the sun than a white one. You may also want to use a pressure vent to prevent moisture accumulation.\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nEducation/schools\\\\n\\\\nSee the deployment guide at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Verticals/Education/SRA_Schools/sch\\\\noolSRA_wlan_sba.pdf\\\\n\\\\nUse cases\\\\n\\\\nInstallations in Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets (telecommunications or other electrical equipment)\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing APs near other electrical or telecommunications equipment, keep all wiring and metal away from the antennas and avoid\\\\nplacing the antennas near electrical lines. Do not route wiring electrical or Ethernet in the near field (6 to 15 inches) from the antenna. Try\\\\nto refrain from installing the AP in the electrical closet, as the best place for the AP is as close to the users as possible or practical. If you\\\\nmust remote antenna cables from such a closet, you may be required to use plenum-rated cable (see local fire/safety regulations for more\\\\non this).\\\\n\\\\nBelow are a few URLs for understanding interference:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps9391/ps9393/ps9394/prod_white_paper0900aecd807395a9_ns736_Networking_Sol\\\\nutions_White_Paper.html\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wrlan_wp.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n[https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps10981/white_paper_c11-609300.html)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nInstallations inside and around elevators\\\\n\\\\nElevator coverage can sometimes be accomplished by placing APs in the near field of the elevator, typically on each floor near the elevator\\\\ndoor. Since elevators often have metal doors and the shafts are often concrete or contain other materials that degrade Wi-Fi coverage, it is\\\\nimportant to check the coverage inside the elevator. While such coverage can be challenging, it is often doable, especially if the elevator is\\\\nonly a few floors.\\\\n\\\\nHigh-rise elevators are more challenging since roaming issues are problematic as the client is cycling through a large number of APs rather\\\\nquickly. Some companies that do in-elevator advertising have put a patch antenna on the floor inside the shaft and a patch antenna (or the\\\\nactual AP) on the bottom of the elevator car, while other companies have used leaky coaxial cable running on the side of the shaft.\\\\n\\\\nWhen installing any Wi-Fi equipment inside the elevator cars or shafts, local regulations need to be followed, as many times such\\\\ninstallations are prohibited either for safety reasons or because the building owner or local fire department may prohibit them. Also, it is\\\\ndangerous, and only elevator repair persons or contractors experienced with this kind of work should be in those areas. When the need for\\\\nexternal antennas is a requirement, again position/use the Catalyst 9120e model.\\\\n\\\\n## WLAN best practices: Catalyst 9120\\\\n\\\\nAccess point antenna placement\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120i access point has an advanced antenna system but correct placement of the AP is critical.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 37.**\\\\n\\\\nCoverage is optimized for ceiling placement and radiates omnidirectionally\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a Wi Fi device such as an AP and you are going to use another AP in the vicinity on a different channel, it is recommended that\\\\nyou space each AP apart by approximately 6 feet (2 meters). Avoid clustering the APs or the antennas from different APs together, as this\\\\ncould cause degradation in performance. This recommended distance is based on the assumption that both devices operate in the\\\\nunlicensed band and do not transmit RF energy more than 23 dB - that is, 200 mW. If higher power is used, space farther apart.\\\\n\\\\nShould you have other devices that transmit, especially if they operate in the same frequency ranges, for example, frequency-hopping\\\\nlegacy APs or other devices that operate close in frequency to those of the AP (think below or above the 2.4 and 5-GHz band), you should\\\\nconsider moving or separating the devices as far apart as can reasonably be done. After you have done this, check for interference by\\\\ntesting both devices at the same time under heavy utilization (load) and then characterize each system independently to see how much, if\\\\nany, degradation exists.\\\\n\\\\nWarning\\\\n\\\\nIn order to comply with FCC, EU, and EFTA RF exposure limits, antennas should be located at a minimum of 7.9 inches\\\\n(20 centimeters) or more from the body of all persons. See the installation guide under declaration of conformity for more on this.\\\\n\\\\nMixing access points of different models and types\\\\n\\\\nThe Catalyst 9120 is a very advanced access point supporting Wi-Fi 6 features along with unique features such as dual 5 GHz and\\\\nadvanced RF detection using Cisco custom RF ASIC silicon.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, it is not recommended that you mix access point models, sometimes called “salt and pepper,” as it would diminish the\\\\nperformance of the Cisco DNA network, degrading many of our advanced features and perhaps introducing a suboptimal performance.\\\\n\\\\nFor this reason, if you have a mixture of AP types, it is recommended that you group like access points together (for example, AP-3800s\\\\non, say, one floor and Cisco Catalyst 9120s on another) and refrain from mixing them.\\\\n\\\\nCatalyst 9120 general placement guidelines\\\\n\\\\nThe following are some guidelines to remember regarding access point installations.\\\\n\\\\n1. Always try to mount the AP as close to the users as possible for best performance. Be aware of the environment (for example, hospitals\\\\n\\\\nhave metal doors, coverage can change when the doors close, old buildings can have metal grid work in the plaster or asbestos). Avoid\\\\nmounting the AP or antennas near metal objects, as doing so can change the coverage area affecting clients.\\\\n\\\\n2. When using the 2.4-GHz frequency, the same 1-, 6-, and 11-channel scheme is used as is the 5-GHz channel scheme. Avoid putting all\\\\n\\\\nof the APs on the same channel, and reuse channels as you can.\\\\n\\\\n3. Cisco RRM, FRA, and other features can help automate the process.\\\\n\\\\n4. Try to determine which clients are heavily used, checking the coverage with those clients. For example, a PDA or Wi-Fi phone might not\\\\n\\\\nhave the same range as a notebook or tablet.\\\\n\\\\nTip\\\\n\\\\nVerify coverage using the worst-performing clients that you intend to deploy.\\\\n\\\\n5. While site surveys are highly recommended, if the design is done at half power and Cisco RRM is in place, sometimes a limited site\\\\n\\\\nsurvey (coverage check) is adequate for smaller venues. If this is a very challenging environment, such as train connectivity, gas and oil\\\\nverticals, or large hospitals, Cisco has an Advanced Services team that can be contracted to help you get up to speed or perform your\\\\ninstallation. See your Cisco account team for more information.\\\\n\\\\nExample of a channel coverage model spacing nonoverlapping channels\\\\n\\\\nAntenna cable recommendation\\\\n\\\\nWhenever practical or possible, please keep antenna cable runs as short as possible. Cisco offers Low Loss (LL) and ultralow loss (ULL)\\\\ncables, which have the same characteristics as Times Microwave LMR-400 and LMR-600.\\\\n\\\\nCisco cables carry the part number AIR-CAB (Aironet Cable) and then a length. For example, a 20-ft length of LL cable with RP-TNC\\\\nconnector is Cisco AIR-CAB-020LL-R. These heavy black cables are not plenum rated and are primarily for outdoor use or manufacturing\\\\nareas.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 38.**\\\\n\\\\nWhen drilling holes for cable, allow for the size of the connector (typically 5/8 inch) drill bit\\\\n\\\\n## Wi-Fi 6 installations and site survey considerations\\\\n\\\\nWh t d h i t ll d t d ? N i th ti t l t WLAN d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nrequirements.\\\\n\\\\n- 1:1 replacement assumes the AP was installed in the best place to meet your current coverage and density goals.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- Do you have any coverage issues today that you have not addressed?\\\\n\\\\n- Are there any poorly mounted or suboptimal installations?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - Ideally you should have at least 802.3at (30W PoE) available.\\\\n\\\\n - Wi-Fi 6 might help mitigate a poor design, but nothing beats installing it right the first time.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many tools out there to model and perform site surveys. Cisco has recently worked with Ekahau to import Cisco APs and\\\\nantenna models into their application, which also includes the ability to model BLE as well. The Catalyst 9120 AP model will be in the next\\\\nmaintenance release (current is 10.0.1).\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 39.**\\\\n\\\\nEkahau offers a site survey and WLAN planner software\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing an active survey for placement, it is always best to have the equipment you plan to deploy. Having the actual model that is\\\\nbeing planned for is not always possible at the time that planning is being done. Cisco spends a great deal of effort to ensure that newermodel AP’s RF coverage matches closely with previous models of APs to reduce the cost of planning and replacing APs. The C9120 is no\\\\ndifferent. The below graphic shows the C9120 as compared with the AP3802i on the same channel and power, as an example only.\\\\nSurveying using an alternate AP is suitable for Bill of Material (BOM) generation or updates to an existing installation. Critical coverage\\\\nshould always be measured using the same model to be certain of the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 40.**\\\\n\\\\nComparison of C9120 and AP3802i coverage patterns as measured over the air\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nused.\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 41.**\\\\n\\\\nAccelTex site survey battery pack P/N ATS-SSBP-1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nUseful URLs within the guide:\\\\n\\\\n1.
